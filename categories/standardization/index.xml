      <description>I have a lot of interest in writing systems, which is why you will find a lot of posts on this blog around them. A few years ago, I wrote about the Bharati script, which was touted as an attempt to create a universal script for Indian languages. I had expressed measured skepticism about the idea, but had also said I would like to see the script, and luckily, was contacted by Chetan Shenoy, an undergrad from IIT Madras, who works under Prof Chakravarthy, the creator of the script.</description>

      <title>Could better science reporting standards at the BBC improve the quality of their articles?</title>

      <description>I just came across this article on the BBC Website (Could a new phonetic alphabet promote world peace?) because it was posted in the /r/badlinguistics sub-reddit, and for good reason.
It is such a remarkable mix of bad linguistics and general cluelessness that I would have thought that even with media&amp;rsquo;s generally low standards of science (especially language) reporting, something like this would not have made the cut.
First of all, I am not sure why they even chose to write a whole article around this SaypU thing.</description>

      <title>How do languages change?</title>

      <description>Ojas Patil suggested long ago that I write a post about causes of language change. I had forgotten it until E, who&amp;rsquo;s already given me post fodder once via a comment on a Linguistrix post, asked me a follow-up question on my reply to his comment-question. It was heartening to see that E appeared reasonably convinced by my answers to his first question, and his question is quite interesting—
 So how does language or grammar evolve (Because it certainly _does_ evolve)?</description>

      <title>The VanDamme Academy, and why grammar is not about clarity—Part 2</title>

      <description>[This is Part 2 of the post title. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the first part, please read it here, though this post can be read in isolation too]
An important distinction that people often miss out on is the difference between _grammar_ and _style_—the difference between writing _correctly_ and writing well. And this distinction is very important because it&amp;rsquo;s more or less easy for most native speakers with some amount of training in the standard dialect (and knowledge of things like right spellings) to write correctly.</description>

      <description>Miheer Desai suggested that I check out the Lisa VanDamme channel on YouTube for her views on parenting and teaching. I found the VanDamme Academy fairly interesting, and Ms VanDamme seems to be a very passionate person. Her video response to the Chinese Moms article was also thought-provoking, and it&amp;rsquo;s heartening to see that someone is putting an effort into improving pedagogy and understanding the ways in which we can educate kids in today&amp;rsquo;s world.</description>

      <description>I am surprised I didn&amp;rsquo;t come across this much earlier. Jonathan Swift, a very renowned essayist, poet, satirist, popularly known as the author of Gulliver&amp;rsquo;s Travels, wrote:   If you want to read it yourself, you can do so here, but I would advise against it. There isn&amp;rsquo;t much to be gained, and he&amp;rsquo;s written too much. Jonathan Swift was an intelligent man, and a pretty good writer, so read up his other stuff if you want.</description>

      <title>Poshchim Bongo</title>

      <description>Well, West Bengal recently renamed itself to Poshchim Bongo (পশ্চিমবঙ্গ; pronounced [poʃtʃim bɔŋɡo]). Inhabitants of a place should have the first say about what their place is called, so I don&amp;rsquo;t see any problem there. And a community can choose whatever pronunciation they want, as I had discussed in a previous post. Of course, one would expect that it is worth the millions in taxpayer money that would be spent in the re-branding.</description>
