      <description>New day, new linguistic fodder to chew on, and another quick note!
From an article in today&amp;rsquo;s HT:
 &amp;ldquo;The SC had said that if there is no reason to disbelieve that the accused cannot be reformed or rehabilitated, a sentence of death would be erroneous.&amp;rdquo;
 The moment I read &amp;lsquo;no reason to disbelieve&amp;rsquo;, I knew there was a disaster waiting to happen, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t disappointed. There are a total of 4 negating elements in this text (no reason, disbelieve, cannot be, erroneous)Â and you will see that the meaning is virtually impossible to compute naturally.</description>
