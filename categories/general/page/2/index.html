      <div class="summary">A few days ago, I saw an Onion Tech Trends video: HP Offers &lsquo;That Cloud Thing Everyone Is Talking About.
  The whole video is funny, but what really cracked me up was when the HP spokesman says, at 1:32, We have App.
Evidently, many other people found it funny too—the top comment on the YouTube video makes a reference to that statement, and a quick search I did on Google showed me that this particular line was tweeted and written about quite a bit when the video was launched.</div>

  The fact that the word free has two senses in English is often brought up because the difference in the two senses is sometimes critical/relevant. Especially in the FOSS (Free and Open Software) world, the distinction is often explained as Free as in free speech, not as in free beer, to disambiguate the two senses: one of freedom and another of not having to pay anything.</div>

      <div class="summary">This cartoon appeared today in my Facebook feed:
  I&rsquo;m posting it on Linguistrix because it&rsquo;s a rather cute display of syntactic ambiguity, and for a change, it&rsquo;s in Hindi. Syntactic ambiguity is when a particular sentence can be parsed in more than one grammatically correct ways, each with a different meaning. A popular example is I shot an elephant in my pajamas, which has not two but three parsings—either I was wearing my pyjamas, or the elephant was inside my pajamas, or that the elephant was wearing my pajamas.</div>

      <div class="summary">The Society for Promotion for Undergraduate Research (SPUR) recently launched &lsquo;Scitech Majlis&rsquo;: Weekly group discussion session about science and technology. The name gave rise to a bit of buzz because of the use of the Urdu word majlis (مجلس, मजलिस). When I first heard it, it sounded a bit tone-deaf to me—the two words didn&rsquo;t seem to lend well to compounding, but whatever.
Anyhow, I am no Urdu expert but I do know of some good places where we can look, and I went to my trusted resource, Platts&rsquo; Dictionary of Urdu, Classical Hindi and English.</div>

  Something didn&rsquo;t seem right about the whole thing but SMBC is usually grounded on at least some fact, so I decided to explore, and it turned out to be more interesting than I had earlier thought.
It turns out that the term vanilla (used to describe the beans) does come from the Latin root vagina, but it&rsquo;s not as simple as that.</div>

 In order to improve this application, would you mind giving your experience a star rating?
 Below the question were two command buttons
 No | Rate
 &lsquo;Uh-0h,&rsquo; I said to no one in particular.

The Indian Coal Allocation Scam is being widely referred to as Coalgate, a variation on the Watergate scandal with the added punny bonus of it sounding the same as a popular toothpaste brand.
The Watergate scandal, apart from leading to then president Richard Nixon&rsquo;s resignation, became immortal when countless scandals around the world began getting named after it, all ending in -gate.</div>

 The word bashful is closest in meaning to: A) Shy B) Arrogant

      <div class="summary">I was in Mexico last week and was quite excited to try my Spanish there. I studied some Spanish 3–4 years ago using Michel Thomas courses, and did a few levels on Duolingo, and combined with my French, I can get a general sense of simple written Spanish, but I had literally zero on-ground speaking experience. There are plenty of Spanish speakers in California, so it&rsquo;s not difficult at all to find people to chat with if you really care, but it somehow never happened.</div>

I first thought of writing a review without spoilers but realized that it&rsquo;d be impossible to write about the linguistically relevant parts of the movie without giving it all away, so I scrapped that plan. This review specifically addresses only and all linguistic aspects of the movie, so it might feel like nitpicking if you are not interested in all that stuff.</div>

      <div class="summary">RVC recently told me about Through the Language Glass, a book by Guy Deutscher (GD), an Israeli linguist, that is based around the premise of &lsquo;linguistic relativity&rsquo;. Ordinarily, hearing those two words together evokes a bit of a fight / flight response in me, so I read the excerpts he sent with some trepidation. I realized that, far from being yet another piece fawning over linguistic relativity, this book actually seemed to be addressing many questions I had about this topic but had never seen properly answered.</div>

There is a lot of self-congratulatory rhetoric in India about how Indian scripts are very &lsquo;scientific&rsquo;. On the contrary, the English script (which, in most cases, is the only other kind of script most Indians know) is criticized for being arbitrary, ambiguous, unscientific, what have you.</div>

It is such a remarkable mix of bad linguistics and general cluelessness that I would have thought that even with media&rsquo;s generally low standards of science (especially language) reporting, something like this would not have made the cut.
First of all, I am not sure why they even chose to write a whole article around this SaypU thing.</div>
