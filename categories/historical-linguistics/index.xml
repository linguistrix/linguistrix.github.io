      <description>Ojas Patil suggested long ago that I write a post about causes of language change.

      <description>[I am writing a series of articles on Languages and Linguistics for a magazine for school kids, EducationEdge, that a friend of mine has started recently. These articles are targeted at students of classes VIII to XII. I will keep posting those articles on Linguistrix once they are published. Here&#39;s the first in the series.]  “Those who know nothing of foreign languages know nothing of their own.”
—Johann Wolfgang von Goethe  Every human possesses an innate ability to acquire language.</description>
