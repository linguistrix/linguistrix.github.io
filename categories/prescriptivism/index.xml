      <title>How do languages change?</title>

      <description>Ojas Patil suggested long ago that I write a post about causes of language change. I had forgotten it until E, who&amp;rsquo;s already given me post fodder once via a comment on a Linguistrix post, asked me a follow-up question on my reply to his comment-question. It was heartening to see that E appeared reasonably convinced by my answers to his first question, and his question is quite interesting—
 So how does language or grammar evolve (Because it certainly _does_ evolve)?</description>

      <description>Someone called E has posted a question in the comments section of my last post—The VanDamme Academy, and why grammar is not about clarity—Part 2. I was going to answer it there itself, but I realized this had enough material to be a post, so here it goes.
First, his question:
 So, what, according to you, is &amp;lsquo;unconditionally ungrammatical&amp;rsquo; about _They is walking_? If it conveys all the information the speaker intends to convey, unambiguously, the only thing wrong with it is the fact that it does not follow convention (the convention of conjugating a verb a certain way with certain subjects)</description>

      <description>[This is Part 2 of the post title. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the first part, please read it here, though this post can be read in isolation too]
An important distinction that people often miss out on is the difference between _grammar_ and _style_—the difference between writing _correctly_ and writing well. And this distinction is very important because it&amp;rsquo;s more or less easy for most native speakers with some amount of training in the standard dialect (and knowledge of things like right spellings) to write correctly.</description>

      <description>Miheer Desai suggested that I check out the Lisa VanDamme channel on YouTube for her views on parenting and teaching. I found the VanDamme Academy fairly interesting, and Ms VanDamme seems to be a very passionate person. Her video response to the Chinese Moms article was also thought-provoking, and it&amp;rsquo;s heartening to see that someone is putting an effort into improving pedagogy and understanding the ways in which we can educate kids in today&amp;rsquo;s world.</description>

      <description>Sindhu, a lawyer friend, sent me this on chat:
 You should do a post on who v. whom. VERY confusing, I say!
 &amp;#8230; to which I replied that she didn&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about it and as long as she trusted her instinct, it was just fine, but she said:
 Yes, but it is important to know the difference. At our firm, we are very particular about pristine English in mails to clients.</description>

      <description>I am surprised I didn&amp;rsquo;t come across this much earlier. Jonathan Swift, a very renowned essayist, poet, satirist, popularly known as the author of Gulliver&amp;rsquo;s Travels, wrote:   If you want to read it yourself, you can do so here, but I would advise against it. There isn&amp;rsquo;t much to be gained, and he&amp;rsquo;s written too much. Jonathan Swift was an intelligent man, and a pretty good writer, so read up his other stuff if you want.</description>

      <description>[This article has undergone a few edits after being published. I see that the whole discussion is revolving around issues peripheral to the theme of the post. In this post, I am denouncing the concept of purity being attached to Sanskritized Hindi, so I have removed bits I care less about and which are not directly relevant to the issue.]
14th September is celebrated in India as Hindi Divas (हिंदी दिवस).</description>

      <description>[This is the continuation of a series of articles on Languages and Linguistics that I am writing for a magazine for school kids, EducationEdge, that a friend of mine has started recently. These articles are targeted at students of classes VIII to XII. I will keep posting those articles on Linguistrix once they are published. The first article can be found here.]
In the previous article, I introduced you to Linguistics and discussed a few examples from various fields within this discipline.</description>
