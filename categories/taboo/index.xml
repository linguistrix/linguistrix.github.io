      <description>Kapil Sibbal wants Facebook etc. to continuously monitor content so that anything that insults any one in the ruling party is nipped in the bud. And now, an Indian court has ordered FB and other social networking websites to remove offensive content by Feb 6. The plaintiff has submitted a CD full of objectionable content found on online media, and wants it removed.
Language and censorship go hand in hand. When you have people who want to say stuff, you have people who don&amp;rsquo;t want it being said.</description>

      <description>In what&amp;rsquo;s minty fresh news, Liverpool striker Suarez was given an 8-match ban for racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. You may read about it here. Santosh Ananthakrishnan sent me the link to a discussion about the same on WebDiplomacy Forums.
I am a football n00b, and reading news reports about this incident has been an ordeal due to a bevy of unfamiliar names and abbreviations, but from what I have understood so far, the defence is that whatever Suarez called Evra is actually a playful and casual term where Suarez comes from.</description>
