      <div class="summary">I have planned a multi-part series on the topic of learning languages. It is aimed at serving two purposes—answering questions around this issue that many people have asked me in the past few years, and putting into words my observations of what worked best for me or others around me, and where I felt I or others could have done better. The series will roughly address the following issues—</div>

      <div class="summary">Since everyone and their grandmother is busy listening to Why this Kolaveri Di for the 4157th time in 3 days (What! You haven&rsquo;t heard it yet? Get out from under that rock already!), I thought I&rsquo;d write this short note on a couple of points of linguistic interest in that song.

Apart from the extremely catchy tune that refuses to get out of your head even when you are asleep (I am sure loads of people have this song running like a sinister background score in their dreams), one of the things that make this song fun is of course the strongly Tamil accented English.</div>

      <div class="summary">The first entry on the WTF files on Linguistrix is supposedly a quote by Jimmy Wales published in today&rsquo;s HT (Wikipedia woos India with local languages). I say supposedly because I really hope that this attribution is incorrect, that this is the result of stupid paraphrasing, and that Jimmy Wales didn&rsquo;t actually say something so hopelessly asinine—
 “In languages such as Latin, expressing an idea becomes difficult because the language is not commonly spoken and written.</div>

A few weeks ago, I wrote about how a newspaper article in the HT messed up a sentence due to too many negative particles and ended up meaning exactly the opposite of what was intended. On the other side of the spectrum is a dialogue from The Big Bang Theory&rsquo;s latest episode (S05E10, The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition). The moment I heard it, I whooped with excitement—a perfectly executed quadruple negative, I thought, just as Amy pointed it out for the whole world to notice.</div>

The first part of the tweet is of course absolutely unidiomatic, but you can figure out what it is trying to say.

      <div class="summary">Sanyam wrote in to ask: &rsquo;Is it true, that we can pronounce proper nouns as we deem fit?&rsquo;
As far as I understand from my experience at school, this &lsquo;myth&rsquo; is more a result of school kids trying to excuse themselves of pronouncing English names correctly by resorting to a bogey rule that you can pronounce a proper noun the way you want. Here&rsquo;s my personal take on this—
In short, I would say, &lsquo;an individual has the right to assert that a particular sequence of sounds (and its corresponding transcription) is their name&rsquo;.</div>

 &ldquo;Your message will appear in SymphonyxIITB momentarily.&rdquo;
 My (and Pritish&rsquo;s, I presume, from his responses) first instinct was this was obviously wrong. In my idiolect, _momentarily_ could only be used for the sense _&lsquo;for a moment&rsquo;_ whereas Google was using it for &lsquo;in a moment&rsquo;. Google is not averse to relatively weird constructions as was discussed in this post on LanguageLog, so I presumed this was the case here too.</div>

      <div class="summary">I saw this at Port Blair airport today, on my way back from an excellent family vacation at Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Language errors on notices and boards are very common and are tracked by countless blogs and humor websites. Since most of these follow typical patterns like spelling mistakes (MISSILE PAAV or anything any IITB Hostel Canteen menu lists) or bad grammar, they are funny but mostly unremarkable. However, I am posting this one here since I have the feeling that this wasn&rsquo;t so much a result of lack of competence as plain confusion.</div>

 The word bashful is closest in meaning to: A) Shy B) Arrogant

      <div class="summary">I was in Mexico last week and was quite excited to try my Spanish there. I studied some Spanish 3–4 years ago using Michel Thomas courses, and did a few levels on Duolingo, and combined with my French, I can get a general sense of simple written Spanish, but I had literally zero on-ground speaking experience. There are plenty of Spanish speakers in California, so it&rsquo;s not difficult at all to find people to chat with if you really care, but it somehow never happened.</div>

Ordinarily, hearing those two words together evokes a bit of a fight / flight response in me, so I read the excerpts he sent with some trepidation. I realized that, far from being yet another piece fawning over linguistic relativity, this book actually seemed to be addressing many questions I had about this topic but had never seen properly answered.</div>

There is a lot of self-congratulatory rhetoric in India about how Indian scripts are very &lsquo;scientific&rsquo;. On the contrary, the English script (which, in most cases, is the only other kind of script most Indians know) is criticized for being arbitrary, ambiguous, unscientific, what have you.</div>

It is such a remarkable mix of bad linguistics and general cluelessness that I would have thought that even with media&rsquo;s generally low standards of science (especially language) reporting, something like this would not have made the cut.
First of all, I am not sure why they even chose to write a whole article around this SaypU thing.</div>
