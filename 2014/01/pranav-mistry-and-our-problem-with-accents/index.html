<p>Since then, he has been in and out of limelight, and has generally been on the receiving end of a lot of (well deserved) love and admiration from Indians, especially because he comes off as a &lsquo;son of the soil&rsquo;. No where is this more obvious than when you hear him speak.</p>

<p>A few months ago, when Pranav Mistry announced the Samsung Galaxy Gear as the Director of Research of Samsung Research America, his accent was almost as much a topic of discussion on the internet as the technology he presented. It is true that Pranav speaks in a strong Gujarati accent (some internet sources say it&rsquo;s a Kathiawadi Gujarati accent, but I don&rsquo;t know enough about them to tell them apart), and discussions about Pranav&rsquo;s accent aren&rsquo;t new. He isn&rsquo;t particularly fluent either, so his talks can be quite jarring even otherwise. I did see a few tweets suggesting that the video telecast of his Galaxy Gear presentation should have been subtitled, which is of course a very reasonable expectation, and which I think should be standard procedure for any talk aimed at an international audience, irrespective of the speaker&rsquo;s accent.</p>

<p>There were several caustic comments on social media about the way he speaks, and counter-tweets to those defending Pranay and also criticizing those who change their accents when they go abroad.</p>

<p>Loads of sensible people did raise their voices against the tide of pointless criticism leveled against Pranav&rsquo;s accent. But, among the many who rightly rose in Pranav&rsquo;s defense were people who somehow saw his preservation of his childhood accent as some kind of virtue. Aakar Patel, for instance, wrote an article that criticized those who found Pranav&rsquo;s accent embarrassing, and added:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mistry is smart enough to make it to the world’s technology elite. And honest and confident enough not to change the way he pronounces words from the way he learnt them in his Palanpur school.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Judging Pranav based on his so-called non-posh accent is wrong, but it is equally wrong to suggest that preserving / maintaining one&rsquo;s native accent is a sign of being true to one&rsquo;s roots, whatever the hell that means, and that not doing so is in some sense selling out.</p>

<p>Linguistically speaking, everyone has an accent, but in everyday speak, people who sound different from how the rest of the crowd does are usually said to have an accent. Or, occasionally, anyone who doesn&rsquo;t speak the standard / prestige dialect is said to have an accent.</p>

<p>As a language learning enthusiast, I usually pay keen attention to native speakers&rsquo; pronunciation and try to get as close to it as possible. For me, it&rsquo;s a very happy moment indeed if a native speaker says that I sound almost like them. This works for most foreign languages, but not that much for English, because there&rsquo;s hardly one variety of English<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Indian kids usually grow up learning Indian English, with their native accent superimposed over whatever the local English accent is. Personally, I&rsquo;m usually a sort of accent chameleon, accommodating my speech to that of the listener. So, the way I&rsquo;d speak to a native speaker of American English would be different from the way I&rsquo;d speak to a native Japanese speaker talking in English.</p>

<p>People take on different accents for a variety of reasons. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s just to make yourself easier to understand. Or to better assimilate with the group you are in. Or as a natural progression towards native fluency. And sometimes, it&rsquo;s just an inevitable result of spending a lot of time exposed to other accents. Some people, however, tend to judge merely the presence of more than one accent as a bad thing, as if one is putting on a mask and hiding their true self. I find it hard to sympathize with such a position. I think there is nothing glorious about adopting a new accent, nor is there anything praiseworthy about keeping yours. It&rsquo;s just a personal choice.</p>

<p>It is of course one thing if a person goes out of their way to speak in a different accent just to assert superiority or to sound condescending, but adopting accents that suit your audience (or, adopting a relatively &lsquo;international&rsquo; accent which isn&rsquo;t too strongly tempered by regional accents) sounds like a perfectly normal or natural thing to do. It is perfectly fine if Pranav prefers to stick to his native accent, but those who choose otherwise aren&rsquo;t necessarily traitors.</p>

<p>A friend of mine very recently mentioned how an ex-IITM professor who&rsquo;s now at MIT gave her talk in an Americanized accent, and how it pissed him off, because well, what was the point of her accent when she anyhow clearly looked and was &lsquo;desi&rsquo; (Valley-speak for &lsquo;Indian&rsquo;). I found his anger rather misplaced. After all, she was addressing an American audience, so it&rsquo;d make sense to speak in an American accent. I am sure the same person would speak pretty differently if she was delivering a talk at IITM.</p>

<p>To me, languages and accents are fascinating sources of diversity. It&rsquo;s fun to examine your own, and it&rsquo;s fun to pick up and learn those of people around you.</p>

 The word bashful is closest in meaning to: A) Shy B) Arrogant
 About 6 years ago, I wrote about how I had discovered that I had been pronouncing awry, well, differently. I had another such moment of surprise last night, when I realized that the word bashful doesn&rsquo;t mean what I used to this it does.</div>

      <h2 class="title">Yet another woe of non-phonetic writing systems</h2>
      <div class="summary">I was in Mexico last week and was quite excited to try my Spanish there. I studied some Spanish 3–4 years ago using Michel Thomas courses, and did a few levels on Duolingo, and combined with my French, I can get a general sense of simple written Spanish, but I had literally zero on-ground speaking experience. There are plenty of Spanish speakers in California, so it&rsquo;s not difficult at all to find people to chat with if you really care, but it somehow never happened.</div>

      <div class="summary">Arpan suggested that I review Arrival, a SciFi movie that has as its lead character—wait for it—a linguistics professor. I first thought of writing a review without spoilers but realized that it&rsquo;d be impossible to write about the linguistically relevant parts of the movie without giving it all away, so I scrapped that plan. This review specifically addresses only and all linguistic aspects of the movie, so it might feel like nitpicking if you are not interested in all that stuff.</div>

      <div class="summary">RVC recently told me about Through the Language Glass, a book by Guy Deutscher (GD), an Israeli linguist, that is based around the premise of &lsquo;linguistic relativity&rsquo;. Ordinarily, hearing those two words together evokes a bit of a fight / flight response in me, so I read the excerpts he sent with some trepidation. I realized that, far from being yet another piece fawning over linguistic relativity, this book actually seemed to be addressing many questions I had about this topic but had never seen properly answered.</div>

      <div class="summary">I recently set the &lsquo;question paper&rsquo; for the Hindi Word Games General Championship (GC) 1 at IIT Bombay. Here are the links to the question set and the solutions. As part of the competition, I decided to put in a round of Hindi Cryptic Puzzles. Cryptic Crosswords are very popular in English, but haven&rsquo;t got much of a traction in the Hindi world. Regular crossword puzzles are fairly common—I remember solving the crossword in the Dainik Bhaskar growing up, but cryptics are relatively unchartered territory.</div>

      <h2 class="title">One script to bind them all</h2>
      <div class="summary">A couple of days ago, I came across a few news reports that a professor from IIT Madras (Professor V Srinivas Chakravarthy) has developed a script (called Bharati) to &ldquo;unify 22 Indian languages&rdquo;. As a script-enthusiast, I was of course slightly interested.
There is a lot of self-congratulatory rhetoric in India about how Indian scripts are very &lsquo;scientific&rsquo;. On the contrary, the English script (which, in most cases, is the only other kind of script most Indians know) is criticized for being arbitrary, ambiguous, unscientific, what have you.</div>

It is such a remarkable mix of bad linguistics and general cluelessness that I would have thought that even with media&rsquo;s generally low standards of science (especially language) reporting, something like this would not have made the cut.
First of all, I am not sure why they even chose to write a whole article around this SaypU thing.</div>

      <div class="summary">A comic that was doing the rounds a few months ago keeps getting revived every once in a while when it gets discovered by a new bunch of people.
