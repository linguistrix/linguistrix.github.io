        <div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>As you may have read, Facebook has <a href="http://ibnlive.in.com/news/facebook-blocks-chutiyas-is-twitter-next/238851-11.html" target="_blank">attracted the anger</a> of—and I swear there is no other way to put it—the Chutiya community from Assam by blocking many Facebook profiles which mentioned Chutiya as their last name. This is of course a bit ironic coming from a company who&rsquo;s CEO&rsquo;s sister is named <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Randi-Zuckerberg/181656281865250" target="_blank">Randi</a> (Hindi insult meaning <em>prostitute</em>), but let&rsquo;s not digress.</p>

<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know Hindi, _Chutiya_ is an expletive that means _fool/idiot_ but is pretty offensive and insulting. As I noted in <a title="Suarez, Evra and Racial Insults" href="http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=387" target="_blank">Suarez, Evra and Racial Insults</a>, the use of expletives is fairly common among friends and those in the same social hierarchy, but this doesn&rsquo;t render them toothless or inoffensive. The name of the Chutiya community, however,  is apparently pronounced as Sutiya (the initial consonant is not the palatal stop [c] but the voiceless alveolar fricative [s]), so you have another victim of arbitrary romanization.</p>

<p>This mass-blocking is unfortunate, but it is clearly a simple mistake on FB&rsquo;s part and I am sure that this is not part of any conspiracy against that community, and it definitely doesn&rsquo;t warrant burning effigies of Facebook (though I am curious as to how that was done—did they burn an effigy of the homepage? or of the logo? or of Zuckerberg?). Facebook merely insists that people use their legal name on their profiles, so once a systematic request is made to FB, I am sure they will remove the block.</p>

<p>How you spell and pronounce your name is always a big problem in India, something I discussed in detail on <a title="Pronouncing proper nouns, like a boss!" href="http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=208" target="_blank">two</a> previous <a title="Poshchim Bongo" href="http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=44" target="_blank">occasions</a>.</p>

<p>Nothing stops anyone from spelling a name the way they want, but it might make sense to tweak the spelling of your name so that it doesn&rsquo;t clash with well-established words used that you might not want to associate your name with. So, if you stay in a country where a large number of people would associate your name with an expletive, you are still within your right to spell it the way you want, but it might be of pragmatic value for you to spell it differently. This isn&rsquo;t a question of who is <em>right</em>. The romanization system that we follow in India is so  chaotic that it&rsquo;s often not even possible to define <em>correctness</em> in that domain. Everyone can stick with the names they want, such as Indians with the surname <em>Boob</em>, or the surname _Lund_ (Hindi equivalent of dick/cock), but they are likely to spend their lifetime being on the receiving end of tiresome jokes and jibes.</p>

<p>Oh, by the way, since we are on the topic of the word <em>chutiya,</em> I have something interesting about the meaning of this word. Read on.</p>

<p>I used to assume that <em>chutiya</em> developed as the female counterpart of <em>launda</em> (one who has a <em>lund</em> [penis]) which means _guy/dude._ I expected that _chutiya_ would mean<em> one who has a vagina</em>, possibly used in a pejorative sense. I assumed that it might have originally been used as an insult for guys who were effeminate/sissy, and that it slowly changed into its current meaning—stupid/foolish.</p>

<p>All was well until someone at IIT claimed that _chutiya_ meant <em>&lsquo;one born out of a vagina&rsquo;</em>, and that he couldn&rsquo;t be called _chutiya_ since he was born by Caesarean section. I thought this was hogwash—most expletives of this kind usually assert something offensive, whether it be claims of incest or of promiscuity or be it rude references to next of kin. Being born out of a vagina is the default situation, and I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how it could be insulting in any way. Surprisingly, however, even <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=chutia" target="_blank">Urban Dictionary</a> mentions this meaning. It was all hazy until I decided to look in <a href="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/platts/" target="_blank">Platts Dictionary</a> of Urdu, Classical Hindi and English, one of the best works of its kind. Let&rsquo;s look at what Platts has to say about this word:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  H چوتيا चूतिया <em>ćūtiyā</em> [<em>ćūt</em>, q.v.+Prk. इओ=S. इकः], s.m. <span style="color: #0000ff;">One who lives on the earnings of his wife's prostitution; a term of abuse, a blockhead, dolt</span>:—<em>ćūtiyā-paṭait</em>, <em>ćūtiyā-ćakkar</em>, <em>ćūtiyā-ćampaʼī</em>, s.m. A blockhead, a fool:—<em>ćūtiyā-shahīd</em>, s.m. A cully, a dupe;—(slang) a man who kills himself by excess of venery, a martyr to venery.
</p>

<p>This makes much more sense to me, and I am prepared to believe it. _Chutiya_ does, in some sense,  mean _out of the vagina_ but it doesn&rsquo;t refer to the process of childbirth, but rather refers to <em>earning out of the [wife&rsquo;s] vagina</em>.</p>

<p>Languages never cease to be fascinating.</p>

 The word bashful is closest in meaning to: A) Shy B) Arrogant

      <div class="summary">I was in Mexico last week and was quite excited to try my Spanish there. I studied some Spanish 3–4 years ago using Michel Thomas courses, and did a few levels on Duolingo, and combined with my French, I can get a general sense of simple written Spanish, but I had literally zero on-ground speaking experience. There are plenty of Spanish speakers in California, so it&rsquo;s not difficult at all to find people to chat with if you really care, but it somehow never happened.</div>

      <div class="summary">Arpan suggested that I review Arrival, a SciFi movie that has as its lead character—wait for it—a linguistics professor. I first thought of writing a review without spoilers but realized that it&rsquo;d be impossible to write about the linguistically relevant parts of the movie without giving it all away, so I scrapped that plan. This review specifically addresses only and all linguistic aspects of the movie, so it might feel like nitpicking if you are not interested in all that stuff.</div>

      <div class="summary">RVC recently told me about Through the Language Glass, a book by Guy Deutscher (GD), an Israeli linguist, that is based around the premise of &lsquo;linguistic relativity&rsquo;. Ordinarily, hearing those two words together evokes a bit of a fight / flight response in me, so I read the excerpts he sent with some trepidation. I realized that, far from being yet another piece fawning over linguistic relativity, this book actually seemed to be addressing many questions I had about this topic but had never seen properly answered.</div>

Here are the links to the question set and the solutions. As part of the competition, I decided to put in a round of Hindi Cryptic Puzzles. Cryptic Crosswords are very popular in English, but haven&rsquo;t got much of a traction in the Hindi world. Regular crossword puzzles are fairly common—I remember solving the crossword in the Dainik Bhaskar growing up, but cryptics are relatively unchartered territory.</div>

      <div class="summary">A couple of days ago, I came across a few news reports that a professor from IIT Madras (Professor V Srinivas Chakravarthy) has developed a script (called Bharati) to &ldquo;unify 22 Indian languages&rdquo;. As a script-enthusiast, I was of course slightly interested.
There is a lot of self-congratulatory rhetoric in India about how Indian scripts are very &lsquo;scientific&rsquo;. On the contrary, the English script (which, in most cases, is the only other kind of script most Indians know) is criticized for being arbitrary, ambiguous, unscientific, what have you.</div>

It is such a remarkable mix of bad linguistics and general cluelessness that I would have thought that even with media&rsquo;s generally low standards of science (especially language) reporting, something like this would not have made the cut.
First of all, I am not sure why they even chose to write a whole article around this SaypU thing.</div>
