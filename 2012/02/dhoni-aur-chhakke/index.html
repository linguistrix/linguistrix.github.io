          <p>If you&rsquo;ve been online on FB/Twitter today, you must have noticed that the Indian part of the inter-web has gone crazy over a supposed screenshot from a Star News telecast. I say <em>supposed</em> because my Facebook feed has been flooded with all kinds of stupidity in the last few days—from images of Gods <a href="http://a6.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/409531_365381240139818_100000038347737_1438486_2132740108_n.jpg" target="_blank">magically</a> appearing on the top of mountains to <a href="http://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/423548_173071509469429_135053696604544_253808_56745101_n.jpg" target="_blank">claims</a> that Louis Braille was an Italian king—so naturally I have developed a deep distrust of all society.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter" src="https://i1.wp.com/a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/398397_217479301682550_153904844706663_423147_1411481133_n.jpg?resize=422%2C319" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" />
</p>

<p>This is not the first such instance. The media seems to have a thing for Dhoni and what goes on down under.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://i2.wp.com/4.bp.blogspot.com/_omuQRYZ6gkI/SjivObvkPeI/AAAAAAAABOQ/rH0eDfIDECk/s400/dhoni_indiatv_bat_twelve_12_inch.jpg" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>

<p>Of course, the second one&rsquo;s from India TV, so they might have deliberately put it that way for all you know. For those who don&rsquo;t know Hindi, the second one translates to &lsquo;Dhoni&rsquo;s 12-incher will get us the World Cup!&rsquo; while the text on the first image says &lsquo;<em>Sabse Keemati Chhakka&rsquo;</em>, which translates to &lsquo;Most expensive <em>chhakka&rsquo;. Chhakka</em> refers to the term for &lsquo;6 runs&rsquo; in cricket (for those who don&rsquo;t know about cricket, don&rsquo;t bother wrapping your mind around it). But <em>Chhakka </em>(also, <em>Hijra</em>) in Hindi also refers to (and I borrow Wikipedia&rsquo;s definition here) physiological males who have feminine gender identity, women&rsquo;s clothing and other feminine gender roles and usually live in well-defined, organized, all-hijra communities. In short, it&rsquo;s the kind of thing that makes an Indian family disown its child and leave it to live its messed up life the way it sees fit. The social ramifications of being a c_hakka_ in South Asia are soul-crushingly cruel, but since this is Linguistrix, and not SadThingsAboutIndiaTrix, I would refrain from talking about them in this post.</p>

<p>Now, the bisemy of the word <em>Chhakka</em>, and the puns that result out of it, are hardly new fare. Any person who&rsquo;s lived his way through school in North India would have been either on the receiving end or the perpetrating end of such wordplay at least once in his life. This of course does not mean that they are aware of what <em>chhakkas</em> really are—for most, it&rsquo;s a species that is supposed to be made fun of and the only kind of beggars their parents always give some money to. But, I digress.</p>

<p>The reason I wrote this post was to look at what it is that causes such puns, i.e. when does the interpretation veer enough towards the unintended one to make it funny. Language Log has a category of posts called Crash Blossoms  (a kind of Garden Path sentence where your mind keeps going onto multiple interpretations due to the polysemy of the words involved). An example would be the headline <em>Doctor Suspected in Town House Collapse Dies.</em> It doesn&rsquo;t take much to spot such difficult to parse headlines and correct them, yet they routinely get overlooked by the subeditors.</p>

<p>__I am interested in how much a particular usage needs to be polarized towards one meaning for that meaning to be activated in the listener/reader&rsquo;s mind. For instance, many other usages of the word _chhakka_ in the context of cricket can also be interpreted in the <em>Hijra</em> sense very conveniently, but they aren&rsquo;t. This is an actual line from a report I took from a news website—उस एक छक्के ने वर्ल्डकप फाइनल की यादें ताजा कर दी। In fact, now that I think of it, I am not sure whether the first picture was funny when it was actually being shown, or is it only funny now when we look at it in isolation. Would adding a few words around it dilute the one-sidedness of the meaning? Even in isolation? Questions, questions, questions.</p>

      <div class="summary">Quick question. Answer instictively without trying to over-analyze.
 The word bashful is closest in meaning to: A) Shy B) Arrogant
 About 6 years ago, I wrote about how I had discovered that I had been pronouncing awry, well, differently. I had another such moment of surprise last night, when I realized that the word bashful doesn&rsquo;t mean what I used to this it does.</div>

      <h2 class="title">Yet another woe of non-phonetic writing systems</h2>
      <div class="summary">I was in Mexico last week and was quite excited to try my Spanish there. I studied some Spanish 3–4 years ago using Michel Thomas courses, and did a few levels on Duolingo, and combined with my French, I can get a general sense of simple written Spanish, but I had literally zero on-ground speaking experience. There are plenty of Spanish speakers in California, so it&rsquo;s not difficult at all to find people to chat with if you really care, but it somehow never happened.</div>

      <div class="summary">Arpan suggested that I review Arrival, a SciFi movie that has as its lead character—wait for it—a linguistics professor. I first thought of writing a review without spoilers but realized that it&rsquo;d be impossible to write about the linguistically relevant parts of the movie without giving it all away, so I scrapped that plan. This review specifically addresses only and all linguistic aspects of the movie, so it might feel like nitpicking if you are not interested in all that stuff.</div>

      <div class="summary">RVC recently told me about Through the Language Glass, a book by Guy Deutscher (GD), an Israeli linguist, that is based around the premise of &lsquo;linguistic relativity&rsquo;. Ordinarily, hearing those two words together evokes a bit of a fight / flight response in me, so I read the excerpts he sent with some trepidation. I realized that, far from being yet another piece fawning over linguistic relativity, this book actually seemed to be addressing many questions I had about this topic but had never seen properly answered.</div>

I had expressed measured skepticism about the idea, but had also said I would like to see the script, and luckily, was contacted by Chetan Shenoy, an undergrad from IIT Madras, who works under Prof Chakravarthy, the creator of the script.</div>

      <div class="summary">I recently set the &lsquo;question paper&rsquo; for the Hindi Word Games General Championship (GC) 1 at IIT Bombay. Here are the links to the question set and the solutions. As part of the competition, I decided to put in a round of Hindi Cryptic Puzzles. Cryptic Crosswords are very popular in English, but haven&rsquo;t got much of a traction in the Hindi world. Regular crossword puzzles are fairly common—I remember solving the crossword in the Dainik Bhaskar growing up, but cryptics are relatively unchartered territory.</div>

      <h2 class="title">One script to bind them all</h2>
      <div class="summary">A couple of days ago, I came across a few news reports that a professor from IIT Madras (Professor V Srinivas Chakravarthy) has developed a script (called Bharati) to &ldquo;unify 22 Indian languages&rdquo;. As a script-enthusiast, I was of course slightly interested.
There is a lot of self-congratulatory rhetoric in India about how Indian scripts are very &lsquo;scientific&rsquo;. On the contrary, the English script (which, in most cases, is the only other kind of script most Indians know) is criticized for being arbitrary, ambiguous, unscientific, what have you.</div>

      <div class="summary">I just came across this article on the BBC Website (Could a new phonetic alphabet promote world peace?) because it was posted in the /r/badlinguistics sub-reddit, and for good reason.
It is such a remarkable mix of bad linguistics and general cluelessness that I would have thought that even with media&rsquo;s generally low standards of science (especially language) reporting, something like this would not have made the cut.
First of all, I am not sure why they even chose to write a whole article around this SaypU thing.</div>

      <div class="summary">A comic that was doing the rounds a few months ago keeps getting revived every once in a while when it gets discovered by a new bunch of people. The comic shows Yoda ordering pizza over the phone, but unable to get his order across because of his mangled word order.
