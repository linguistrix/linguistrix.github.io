        <div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>After 3 years of traveling alone and spending 2 years telling others how to do it, I did something as stupid as forgetting my bag in the bottom luggage hold of the bus after I got down at Kyoto station on the freezing cold morning of 27th January, 2012.</p>

<p>Luckily, I realized this within less than 2 minutes of getting down, and thus began a series of frenzied calls to a &lsquo;Japanese Only&rsquo; emergency number. If I could talk in English with them, I would probably have shouted something like _Stop the fucking bus!_ (which is of course optimistic to the point of ridiculousness—a Japanese driver would donate his only kidney more readily than delay public transport). But my Japanese is only good enough to convey what I want to convey in a gentle, civil fashion, so I did just that. I calmed down, and explained to him what had happened. Finally, I did get my luggage back, due in part to Japan&rsquo;s efficient and speedy goods delivery services, not to mention the inherent niceness of the people here. And there goes another &lsquo;experience&rsquo; in the pool, and next time I tell juniors not to forget their luggage, I will have a first-hand story to narrate.</p>

<p>So, what had this got to do with linguistics? Nothing, really, but I was feeling a bit ashamed of myself, and thought that a visit to the Linguistrix confession box would help.</p>

<p>But what happened later that day _does_ have to do with linguistics. Just before catching the train from Nara to Kyoto, I headed into a convenience store and, among other things, grabbed this:</p>

<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2586.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-480" title="IMG_2586" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2586-225x300.jpg?fit=225%2C300" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2586.jpg?resize=225%2C300 225w, https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2586.jpg?w=612 612w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>To tell you the truth, I was driven more by curiosity than anything else. In the few tens of milliseconds it took me to read the label and process it, I wondered what coffee flavored with strawberries would taste like. I like both coffee and strawberries, but I had this lingering suspicion that mixing them wouldn&rsquo;t be that great an idea. What better way to judge this than try it out, I thought, as I grabbed it and proceeded to the checkout queue.</p>

<p>But as I stood on the escalator on the way to the platform and looked at the image on the tetra-pack, I began to think about what it was that I had purchased.</p>

<p>Now, this is a rather interesting issue. _Latte__ _is an Italian word and literally just means _milk_ (and is cognate words such as lactation). The full name for a coffee with milk, i.e. espresso with milk, is Café Latte or Caffè latte (<em>café au lait</em> in French)</p>

<p>But <em>latte</em> is an Italian word, and as far as English is concerned, it’s been lexicalized to mean <em>coffee with milk</em>, not just milk. A <em>Hazelnut Latte</em> generally means a Latte with hazelnut syrup (and a 30% rise in price), not milk with hazelnut syrup. A _skim latte_ is not skim milk, but latte made from skim milk. Likewise, a cinnamon latte, is not cinnamon flavored milk (tasty though it would be), but a milk coffee with cinnamon added to it. But is this terminology only specific to the coffee industry, or is it now universal in the English speaking world? I would go with the latter. I have never seen <em>latte</em> being used in English to refer to milk alone, and If you go to a McDonalds and say that you want a latte along with whatever variety of deep fried meat and starch you’ve ordered, you will be given a coffee, not a tetra-pack of milk (though a lot of McDs do offer milk).</p>

<p>So, what would a Strawberry Latte be? A latte flavoured with strawberries (à la hazelnut latte), or strawberry milk? As far as usage of the word <em>latte</em> in English goes, I think there is no doubt that it should be the first option. In fact, Starbucks actually has a drink of <a href="http://www.starbucksfs.com/Recipes/Espresso/Strawberry_Flavored_Latte" target="_blank">this name</a>, which it describes as <em>&ldquo;Our classic rich, full-bodied Starbucks® espresso in steamed milk lightly topped with foam and complemented by your customers&rsquo; favorite Fontana® flavors.&rdquo;</em>, where Fontana is apparently a brand of strawberry syrup.</p>

<p>The Strawberry Latte I bought was, as you’d have guessed, just strawberry flavored milk.</p>

      <div class="summary">Quick question. Answer instictively without trying to over-analyze.
 The word bashful is closest in meaning to: A) Shy B) Arrogant
 About 6 years ago, I wrote about how I had discovered that I had been pronouncing awry, well, differently. I had another such moment of surprise last night, when I realized that the word bashful doesn&rsquo;t mean what I used to this it does.</div>

      <h2 class="title">Yet another woe of non-phonetic writing systems</h2>
      <div class="summary">I was in Mexico last week and was quite excited to try my Spanish there. I studied some Spanish 3–4 years ago using Michel Thomas courses, and did a few levels on Duolingo, and combined with my French, I can get a general sense of simple written Spanish, but I had literally zero on-ground speaking experience. There are plenty of Spanish speakers in California, so it&rsquo;s not difficult at all to find people to chat with if you really care, but it somehow never happened.</div>

      <div class="summary">Arpan suggested that I review Arrival, a SciFi movie that has as its lead character—wait for it—a linguistics professor. I first thought of writing a review without spoilers but realized that it&rsquo;d be impossible to write about the linguistically relevant parts of the movie without giving it all away, so I scrapped that plan. This review specifically addresses only and all linguistic aspects of the movie, so it might feel like nitpicking if you are not interested in all that stuff.</div>

      <div class="summary">RVC recently told me about Through the Language Glass, a book by Guy Deutscher (GD), an Israeli linguist, that is based around the premise of &lsquo;linguistic relativity&rsquo;. Ordinarily, hearing those two words together evokes a bit of a fight / flight response in me, so I read the excerpts he sent with some trepidation. I realized that, far from being yet another piece fawning over linguistic relativity, this book actually seemed to be addressing many questions I had about this topic but had never seen properly answered.</div>

      <div class="summary">I recently set the &lsquo;question paper&rsquo; for the Hindi Word Games General Championship (GC) 1 at IIT Bombay. Here are the links to the question set and the solutions. As part of the competition, I decided to put in a round of Hindi Cryptic Puzzles. Cryptic Crosswords are very popular in English, but haven&rsquo;t got much of a traction in the Hindi world. Regular crossword puzzles are fairly common—I remember solving the crossword in the Dainik Bhaskar growing up, but cryptics are relatively unchartered territory.</div>

      <h2 class="title">One script to bind them all</h2>
      <div class="summary">A couple of days ago, I came across a few news reports that a professor from IIT Madras (Professor V Srinivas Chakravarthy) has developed a script (called Bharati) to &ldquo;unify 22 Indian languages&rdquo;. As a script-enthusiast, I was of course slightly interested.
There is a lot of self-congratulatory rhetoric in India about how Indian scripts are very &lsquo;scientific&rsquo;. On the contrary, the English script (which, in most cases, is the only other kind of script most Indians know) is criticized for being arbitrary, ambiguous, unscientific, what have you.</div>

      <div class="summary">I just came across this article on the BBC Website (Could a new phonetic alphabet promote world peace?) because it was posted in the /r/badlinguistics sub-reddit, and for good reason.
It is such a remarkable mix of bad linguistics and general cluelessness that I would have thought that even with media&rsquo;s generally low standards of science (especially language) reporting, something like this would not have made the cut.
First of all, I am not sure why they even chose to write a whole article around this SaypU thing.</div>

      <div class="summary">A comic that was doing the rounds a few months ago keeps getting revived every once in a while when it gets discovered by a new bunch of people.
