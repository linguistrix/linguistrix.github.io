          <p>A lot has been said and written about India’s linguistic diversity and about our love for the English language. I have seen Indians being described as slaves of the British or slaves of the English language. I have heard them being accused of harbouring an absurd fascination (/fetish) for English. Not content with attacking Indians for their weird fascination for foreign imports, people then continue on to dissing English, calling it backward, stupid, regressive, and a dozen other adjectives that aren’t even defined over the domain of languages as far as linguistics is concerned.</p>

<p>For once, I agree that the problem exists, is real, and is serious enough, but it hasn’t got as much to do with English itself as it has with India’s double edged sword of linguistic plurality, which is proving itself to be more of a liability than an asset. As a linguiphile, it’s rather hard for me to say this, of course, but I see no way out of the mess that we are in.</p>

<p>It is true that imposition of a non-native language as the prestige language and the language of all commerce leads to a country’s own citizens without knowledge of that language to become marginalized, second-class citizens. It reduces their productivity in the society, leads to under-utilization of their capabilities, and leaves a vast pool of talented and intelligent citizenry unused and wasted. It also causes this stupid association of intelligence and capability with knowledge of English, as if it is not possible to be smart in any language but English.</p>

<p>But I see no easy solution. As long as knowledge of English is mandatory for access to higher education and well-paying jobs, English will continue to be a prestige language. And unless there is a common national language (it is clear that it would be unfair to declare Hindi or Tamil as the common language; but some language has to be the common language), some language will take over that role, and that language, for us, is English, equally foreign to all of us. A friend once suggested that instead of English, Sanskrit should be chosen as the common language. I don’t see how choosing one arbitrary foreign language (I use foreign to mean non-native here) as the common language instead of another arbitrary foreign language will solve any problems, except stoking nationalist egos. In fact, if I had to choose between the two, I would go with English purely for practical reasons.</p>

<p>You could treat each state like a mini-country, making the majority language of the state the official one. School education would have to be in that language, you will need to have top quality institutes of higher education in each state offering degree courses in that language. Likewise, you will need a talented pool of teachers and professors to run who have themselves been educated in the same language. But this is likely to cause problems when people would want to move from one state to another.</p>

<p>You could instead have a North-South divide, with North Indian states working with Hindi, which is still practical, but fixing a common language for South Indians states would still be a hassle.</p>

<p>One thing is clear. It makes little sense to make it a fight against English. It is possible that English got larger than its fair share of encouragement after India’s independence, but I am not sure if things would have unfolded significantly differently even if English didn’t have the head start it did.</p>

<p>I have heard quite a few radical ideas, but I am yet to see any practical, reasonable, non-crazy solution.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

      <div class="summary">Quick question. Answer instictively without trying to over-analyze.
 The word bashful is closest in meaning to: A) Shy B) Arrogant
 About 6 years ago, I wrote about how I had discovered that I had been pronouncing awry, well, differently. I had another such moment of surprise last night, when I realized that the word bashful doesn&rsquo;t mean what I used to this it does.</div>

      <h2 class="title">Yet another woe of non-phonetic writing systems</h2>
      <div class="summary">I was in Mexico last week and was quite excited to try my Spanish there. I studied some Spanish 3–4 years ago using Michel Thomas courses, and did a few levels on Duolingo, and combined with my French, I can get a general sense of simple written Spanish, but I had literally zero on-ground speaking experience. There are plenty of Spanish speakers in California, so it&rsquo;s not difficult at all to find people to chat with if you really care, but it somehow never happened.</div>

      <div class="summary">Arpan suggested that I review Arrival, a SciFi movie that has as its lead character—wait for it—a linguistics professor. I first thought of writing a review without spoilers but realized that it&rsquo;d be impossible to write about the linguistically relevant parts of the movie without giving it all away, so I scrapped that plan. This review specifically addresses only and all linguistic aspects of the movie, so it might feel like nitpicking if you are not interested in all that stuff.</div>

      <div class="summary">RVC recently told me about Through the Language Glass, a book by Guy Deutscher (GD), an Israeli linguist, that is based around the premise of &lsquo;linguistic relativity&rsquo;. Ordinarily, hearing those two words together evokes a bit of a fight / flight response in me, so I read the excerpts he sent with some trepidation. I realized that, far from being yet another piece fawning over linguistic relativity, this book actually seemed to be addressing many questions I had about this topic but had never seen properly answered.</div>

      <div class="summary">I have a lot of interest in writing systems, which is why you will find a lot of posts on this blog around them. A few years ago, I wrote about the Bharati script, which was touted as an attempt to create a universal script for Indian languages. I had expressed measured skepticism about the idea, but had also said I would like to see the script, and luckily, was contacted by Chetan Shenoy, an undergrad from IIT Madras, who works under Prof Chakravarthy, the creator of the script.</div>

      <div class="summary">I recently set the &lsquo;question paper&rsquo; for the Hindi Word Games General Championship (GC) 1 at IIT Bombay. Here are the links to the question set and the solutions. As part of the competition, I decided to put in a round of Hindi Cryptic Puzzles. Cryptic Crosswords are very popular in English, but haven&rsquo;t got much of a traction in the Hindi world. Regular crossword puzzles are fairly common—I remember solving the crossword in the Dainik Bhaskar growing up, but cryptics are relatively unchartered territory.</div>

  Since then, he has been in and out of limelight, and has generally been on the receiving end of a lot of (well deserved) love and admiration from Indians, especially because he comes off as a &lsquo;son of the soil&rsquo;.</div>

      <h2 class="title">One script to bind them all</h2>
      <div class="summary">A couple of days ago, I came across a few news reports that a professor from IIT Madras (Professor V Srinivas Chakravarthy) has developed a script (called Bharati) to &ldquo;unify 22 Indian languages&rdquo;. As a script-enthusiast, I was of course slightly interested.
There is a lot of self-congratulatory rhetoric in India about how Indian scripts are very &lsquo;scientific&rsquo;. On the contrary, the English script (which, in most cases, is the only other kind of script most Indians know) is criticized for being arbitrary, ambiguous, unscientific, what have you.</div>

      <div class="summary">I just came across this article on the BBC Website (Could a new phonetic alphabet promote world peace?) because it was posted in the /r/badlinguistics sub-reddit, and for good reason.
It is such a remarkable mix of bad linguistics and general cluelessness that I would have thought that even with media&rsquo;s generally low standards of science (especially language) reporting, something like this would not have made the cut.
First of all, I am not sure why they even chose to write a whole article around this SaypU thing.</div>

      <div class="summary">A comic that was doing the rounds a few months ago keeps getting revived every once in a while when it gets discovered by a new bunch of people. The comic shows Yoda ordering pizza over the phone, but unable to get his order across because of his mangled word order. It&rsquo;s difficult to not feel pity for the battered Yoda shown in the last frame as he sits biting on a sandwich.</div>
