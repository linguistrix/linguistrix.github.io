      <div class="summary">Every once in a while in human history comes a time when a semantic gap needs to be filled; when a word needs to be born to take on the responsibility it was destined to. A day shall come when lexicographers would lay their pens to rest and take a well deserved retirement. That day is not today. Today, we create a new word.

      <h2 class="title">The double-edged sword of India’s linguistic plurality</h2>
      <div class="summary">A lot has been said and written about India’s linguistic diversity and about our love for the English language. I have seen Indians being described as slaves of the British or slaves of the English language. I have heard them being accused of harbouring an absurd fascination (/fetish) for English. Not content with attacking Indians for their weird fascination for foreign imports, people then continue on to dissing English, calling it backward, stupid, regressive, and a dozen other adjectives that aren’t even defined over the domain of languages as far as linguistics is concerned.</div>

  My heart goes out to the baby, because compound nouns in English can be very very tricky. There is no standard form for interpreting the meaning of a compound noun X-Y.</div>

      <div class="summary">When I was a kid, there was this joke that I often read in one of those magazines for children (I think it was Champak). It was rather lame, but I realized a few days ago that it presented a rather nice analogy of the raging debate between prescriptivism and descriptivism that goes on in academic circles (about language) and so I present an adapted version:
 One day, two friends (a prescriptivist and a descriptivist) are walking inside a forest, when they suddenly realize that a fierce looking lion has been stalking them and looks like it&rsquo;s about to attack them.</div>

The first part is a reference to the cheesy pick-up line &lsquo;If I could rearrange the alphabet, I&rsquo;d put U and I together&rsquo;.
The irregularity of the English spelling system is part of folk-lore now. You have countless poems and articles and whatnots, all trying to hammer in the fact that English pronunciation is the work of the Devil.
English wasn&rsquo;t always this way. Let&rsquo;s travel through time to the 14th century and listen to a recitation of the General Prologue to Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer in Middle English.</div>

      <div class="summary">I recently answered a question on Quora that is also relevant for this blog, so I am posting it here. When speaking to someone who does not seem to be a fluent English speaker, should I &ldquo;dumb down&rdquo; my diction and vocabulary, or is that condescending and presumptuous?{#__w2_mw0UOKH_link}
My answer
It is very easy to make your speech easier to understand to the listener without &lsquo;dumbing&rsquo; it down. Humans anyhow unconsciously accommodate their speech 1 to suit their listener.</div>

      <div class="summary">Dear Hindustan Times,
I will jump straight to the point. Why does Karan Thapar get to fill precious center-page real estate of the Sunday newspaper with content found in boring email forwards? I mean, I know it&rsquo;s your editorial decision and all, but I had expected that you&rsquo;d give more value to your Sunday center-page, otherwise filled with useful and interesting content. You know, if you want your readers to read fascinating and funny stuff about the English language taken from the Web, I would suggest reprinting any of Language Log&rsquo;s posts instead of the mindless drivel that you let KT write just because, well, he&rsquo;s KT.</div>

      <div class="summary">Quick question. Answer instictively without trying to over-analyze.
 The word bashful is closest in meaning to: A) Shy B) Arrogant
 About 6 years ago, I wrote about how I had discovered that I had been pronouncing awry, well, differently. I had another such moment of surprise last night, when I realized that the word bashful doesn&rsquo;t mean what I used to this it does.</div>

      <div class="summary">I was in Mexico last week and was quite excited to try my Spanish there. I studied some Spanish 3–4 years ago using Michel Thomas courses, and did a few levels on Duolingo, and combined with my French, I can get a general sense of simple written Spanish, but I had literally zero on-ground speaking experience. There are plenty of Spanish speakers in California, so it&rsquo;s not difficult at all to find people to chat with if you really care, but it somehow never happened.</div>

      <div class="summary">Arpan suggested that I review Arrival, a SciFi movie that has as its lead character—wait for it—a linguistics professor. I first thought of writing a review without spoilers but realized that it&rsquo;d be impossible to write about the linguistically relevant parts of the movie without giving it all away, so I scrapped that plan. This review specifically addresses only and all linguistic aspects of the movie, so it might feel like nitpicking if you are not interested in all that stuff.</div>

      <div class="summary">RVC recently told me about Through the Language Glass, a book by Guy Deutscher (GD), an Israeli linguist, that is based around the premise of &lsquo;linguistic relativity&rsquo;. Ordinarily, hearing those two words together evokes a bit of a fight / flight response in me, so I read the excerpts he sent with some trepidation. I realized that, far from being yet another piece fawning over linguistic relativity, this book actually seemed to be addressing many questions I had about this topic but had never seen properly answered.</div>

There is a lot of self-congratulatory rhetoric in India about how Indian scripts are very &lsquo;scientific&rsquo;. On the contrary, the English script (which, in most cases, is the only other kind of script most Indians know) is criticized for being arbitrary, ambiguous, unscientific, what have you.</div>

It is such a remarkable mix of bad linguistics and general cluelessness that I would have thought that even with media&rsquo;s generally low standards of science (especially language) reporting, something like this would not have made the cut.
First of all, I am not sure why they even chose to write a whole article around this SaypU thing.</div>
