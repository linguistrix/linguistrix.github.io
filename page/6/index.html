      <div class="summary">Christmas is around the corner, and it seems to be that time of the year when you discover you had been pronouncing a word wrongly all this time.
The word is awry, which I had always thought of as awe-ry, instead of its actual pronunciation a-wry (əˈraɪ).
The funny part is that I learnt of the correct pronunciation while reading someone else&rsquo;s account of how he had been making the same mistake (for a much longer period than mine).</div>

First, his question:
 So, what, according to you, is &lsquo;unconditionally ungrammatical&rsquo; about _They is walking_? If it conveys all the information the speaker intends to convey, unambiguously, the only thing wrong with it is the fact that it does not follow convention (the convention of conjugating a verb a certain way with certain subjects)</div>

An important distinction that people often miss out on is the difference between _grammar_ and _style_—the difference between writing _correctly_ and writing well. And this distinction is very important because it&rsquo;s more or less easy for most native speakers with some amount of training in the standard dialect (and knowledge of things like right spellings) to write correctly.</div>

Our neighbours have a son who must be around 7–8 years old, the age when kids begin to facepalm over the many idiosyncrancies of the English spelling system. I found this stuck on their front door. What was funny was that this actually looks more like an IPA transcription. Of course, the [n] would actually be the velar nasal [ŋ], the [g] is usually there in Indian pronunciation but not in many other dialects and the second vowel would be [ɪ].</div>

      <h2 class="title">We aren’t the only ones with ‘infinite pains’</h2>
      <div class="summary">My views on IITB lingo have changed considerably over the years. I used to find it &lsquo;positively revolting&rsquo; in freshman year, and this slowly changed to &lsquo;occasionally annoying&rsquo; somewhere around third year, finally settling at &lsquo;mostly harmless&rsquo;. I am sure reams of paper have been devoted towards discussing campus lingo in general (there&rsquo;s an entire Masters Thesis about IITM lingo, for instance), so I won&rsquo;t discuss it here.
There are two reasons why I wrote this post, and critiquing IIT lingo isn&rsquo;t either of them—firstly, I wanted to demonstrate how we can investigate simple issues surrounding language usage by using freely and publicly available tools and resources, and secondly, I wanted to talk about how this teaches us to never _assume_ things right-away when dealing with linguistic issues, but to adopt a scientific approach where we try to look at data to prove or disprove our claims instead of blindly trusting our intuition.</div>

      <div class="summary">I was in Mexico last week and was quite excited to try my Spanish there. I studied some Spanish 3–4 years ago using Michel Thomas courses, and did a few levels on Duolingo, and combined with my French, I can get a general sense of simple written Spanish, but I had literally zero on-ground speaking experience. There are plenty of Spanish speakers in California, so it&rsquo;s not difficult at all to find people to chat with if you really care, but it somehow never happened.</div>

There is a lot of self-congratulatory rhetoric in India about how Indian scripts are very &lsquo;scientific&rsquo;. On the contrary, the English script (which, in most cases, is the only other kind of script most Indians know) is criticized for being arbitrary, ambiguous, unscientific, what have you.</div>
