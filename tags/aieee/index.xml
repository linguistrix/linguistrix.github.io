      <description>[Edit: A few days after this post was written, the powers-that-be decided to retain the name JEE for the new entrance test that would replace JEE+AIEEE combo from next year]
The JEE and AIEEE, two flagship examinations that used to be conducted for students aspiring to secure an admission into the IITs/NITs are going to be replaced by an exam called ISEET (Indian Science Engineering Eligibility Test). There are of course loads of issues surrounding this decision that the government took, but none that come under the purview of Linguistrix.</description>
