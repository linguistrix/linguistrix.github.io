      <description>A joke (sorta lame but, whatever) that has been going around on the internet since ages (if pro is the opposite of con, what&amp;rsquo;s the opposite of progress?) was finally picked up and printed on the front page of Mumbai Mirror, in light of today&amp;rsquo;s civic body elections, thus ensuring that the handful of people who hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard it earlier are now aware of it. The grammatical mistake (IT shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been there) and the bad spacing (you need a space after the comma) notwithstanding, a lot of people would find it decently funny, so I thought I would take this opportunity to write a bit about this pun, so to speak, from a linguistic angle, because, well, that&amp;rsquo;s what Linguistrix is all about.</description>
