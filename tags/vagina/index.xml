      <description>The SMBC comic from a few days ago goes like this:
  Something didn&amp;rsquo;t seem right about the whole thing but SMBC is usually grounded on at least some fact, so I decided to explore, and it turned out to be more interesting than I had earlier thought.
It turns out that the term vanilla (used to describe the beans) does come from the Latin root vagina, but it&amp;rsquo;s not as simple as that.</description>

      <description>As you may have read, Facebook has attracted the anger of—and I swear there is no other way to put it—the Chutiya community from Assam by blocking many Facebook profiles which mentioned Chutiya as their last name. This is of course a bit ironic coming from a company who&amp;rsquo;s CEO&amp;rsquo;s sister is named Randi (Hindi insult meaning prostitute), but let&amp;rsquo;s not digress.
For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know Hindi, _Chutiya_ is an expletive that means _fool/idiot_ but is pretty offensive and insulting.</description>
