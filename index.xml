          <description>&lt;p&gt;Quick question. Answer instictively without trying to over-analyze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;em&gt;bashful&lt;/em&gt; is closest in meaning to:
A) Shy B) Arrogant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 6 years ago, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/12/pronunciation-going-awry/&#34;&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; how I had discovered that I had been pronouncing &lt;em&gt;awry&lt;/em&gt;, well, differently. I had another such moment of surprise last night, when I realized that the word &lt;em&gt;bashful&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean what I used to this it does.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I was in Mexico last week and was quite excited to try my Spanish there. I studied some Spanish 3–4 years ago using Michel Thomas courses, and did a few levels on Duolingo, and combined with my French, I can get a general sense of simple written Spanish, but I had literally zero on-ground speaking experience. There are plenty of Spanish speakers in California, so it&amp;rsquo;s not difficult at all to find people to chat with if you really care, but it somehow never happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started right on landing in Cancún as I tried to coordinate a pick-up spot with my Uber driver. Using Google Translate on my phone for quick vocab checks when needed, I was able to get by reasonably well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed that my vocabulary and comfort level with the language grew consistently over the course of the week. This is far from surprising—it&amp;rsquo;s the whole point of immersion, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I once heard a ferry crew member say something ending with &lt;em&gt;maletas&lt;/em&gt;. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what it meant, but the next day, I found a sign that used that word, and from the context, it was clear that &lt;em&gt;maleta&lt;/em&gt; meant suitcase / bag. This is now a word I can start using in conversation as appropriate. On another occasion, we were renting snorkel equipment, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what the Spanish word for the snorkel mask was, but I saw a placard listing prices for &lt;em&gt;chalecos&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;máscaras&lt;/em&gt; etc. and I knew from the previous day&amp;rsquo;s experience that &lt;em&gt;chaleco&lt;/em&gt; meant jacket (in this case, lifejacket), and &lt;em&gt;máscaras&lt;/em&gt; instantly clicked with the English word for the make-up item, and voilà, I had learnt a new word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made me think of how strongly this contrasted with my experience living in Japan. I had studied Japanese for about three semesters and had roughly an N4 level of competency. I could manage plenty of grammatical constructions, could talk about the weather and assorted paraphernalia&amp;#8230; you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bigger issue with Japanese was vocabulary. Since there are hardly any cognates between Japanese and the other languages I knew, I had to build my vocabulary ground up, since you don&amp;rsquo;t get plenty of words for &amp;lsquo;free&amp;rsquo; the way you do for French or Spanish. Typically, here is where immersion really helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I visit a new place I obsessively read all signs, hoardings and the like. If it&amp;rsquo;s a script I am not very fluent with, it takes a while to process them but slowly you start seeing patterns and it helps grow your lexicon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No thanks to the non-phonetic writing systems used by Chinese / Japanese, this is all but impossible to do for these languages. When you visit Japan, you are surrounded by a ton of Japanese text, most of which you can not understand, which is normal for a beginner, but most of which you &lt;em&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t even read&lt;/em&gt;, which is a perversity you encounter only in a select few places in the world.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;./wp-content/uploads/2017/01/compliancesigns-plastic-osha-notice-sign-7-x-5-in.-with-authorized-personnel-only-info-in-english-japanese-white_6636005-1-249x300.jpeg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;A Japanese-English Sign&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When a new learner sees a Japanese (or Chinese) sign, for example, they can probably identify a few characters, but everything else is completely opaque to them. They don&amp;rsquo;t know how it is pronounced or what the word boundaries are and there is no easy way to figure it out. If you know enough characters already, you can kinda sorta make out the meaning of a new character or a bunch of them, but in Japanese, knowing the sound for one of those characters from a previous encounter often isn&amp;rsquo;t much help either because of the multiple readings each character can have (kunyomi, onyomi etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For other languages, you&amp;rsquo;d at least be able to read what the word is, even if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what it means. And if you have a bilingual sign, you can figure out the meanings of multiple unknown words in a sentence by comparing them to their English counterparts, once you have a general sense of the syntax of the target language and some basic vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;./wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Notice-Carrying-Concealed-Weapon-Prohibited-Bilingual-300x278.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;A Spanish-English Sign&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note that this isn&amp;rsquo;t about using the Roman script for all languages. The respective phonetic scripts used by most languages of the world are adequate enough for this. As I have discussed in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=900&#34;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;, learning such scripts is usually not very difficult, and it&amp;rsquo;s just an easy hike you do before you start climbing the actual mountain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a school of pedagogy (that I wholeheartedly agree with) that suggests that students of Chinese be taught the language almost entirely using Romanized Chinese (say, pinyin), and that characters be introduced much later in the curriculum, by which time they have enough context about the language to be able to learn them more easily. This makes sense because the daunting nature of the writing system often acts as a disincentive to learn what is otherwise a relatively easy language, the tonal system notwithstanding. The syntax is relatively straightforward and while the tones can be a challenge, they are not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; bad. Likewise for Japanese where the syllabaries Hiragana and Katakana can be used in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ignoring their inscrutable scripts will definitely make life easier for people learning C/J, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly make up for the missed opportunity for organic vocabulary enrichment that these languages deprive their learners of due to their writing systems.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Movie Review: Arrival</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2016/12/movie-review-arrival/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 18 Dec 2016 09:33:27 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2016/12/movie-review-arrival/</guid>
          <description>

&lt;p&gt;Arpan suggested that I review &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt;, a SciFi movie that has as its lead character—wait for it—a linguistics professor. I first thought of writing a review without spoilers but realized that it&amp;rsquo;d be impossible to write about the linguistically relevant parts of the movie without giving it all away, so I scrapped that plan. This review specifically addresses only and all linguistic aspects of the movie, so it might feel like nitpicking if you are not interested in all that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Read on if you don&amp;rsquo;t mind spoilers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dr-banks-background&#34;&gt;Dr Banks&amp;rsquo; Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read a couple of comments online that were displeased with how the movie introduced the character arc for Dr Banks. I was kinda okay with it, but for the sake of completeness, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about it anyway. The whole &amp;lsquo;Farsi translation&amp;rsquo; thing was a little iffy if you tried to look too deep into it. There is no reason why the military would recruit a random linguistics professor for translating Farsi, when they are likely to have several such translators on payroll anyway. And it wasn&amp;rsquo;t like they needed some classical or &amp;lsquo;ancient&amp;rsquo; version of the language translated where a linguistics professor is more likely to have specific expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, they added a bit about Dr Banks asking the military guy to quiz the second-prospect linguist about the Sanskrit word for war. She was referring to a Sanskrit word (&lt;em&gt;gavishti&lt;/em&gt;) which roughly translates to the desire for cows, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem that it&amp;rsquo;s the primary Sanskrit word for war / battle (which is typically &lt;em&gt;yuddh&lt;/em&gt;). It&amp;rsquo;s not clear why anyone would answer &lt;em&gt;gavishti&lt;/em&gt; if asked the Sanskrit word for war just because it exists, so this attempt to establish the expertise of her character and to touch on the whole &amp;lsquo;mistranslations are common and problematic&amp;rsquo; theme wasn&amp;rsquo;t very convincing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;deciphering-alienese&#34;&gt;Deciphering Alienese&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what felt like an unintentionally funny intro scene for this movie&amp;rsquo;s linguistic adventure, the military colonel whips out a dictaphone-like device and plays out the aliens&amp;rsquo; responses to humans saying &amp;lsquo;Hello&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Why are you here?&amp;rsquo;, asking Dr Banks to translate them. Like the good field linguist she apparently is, she says this was way too little data and she needs to go talk to the aliens face to face if they wished to get any success figuring out what they are saying. And so begins our quest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she decides to use written communication with the aliens and does the whole spiel with writing her name, pointing to herself etc., they respond with two symbols in a circular Rorschach-inkblot-esque script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./wp-content/uploads/2016/11/heptapod-writing-in-arrival.jpeg?resize=400%2C200&#34; alt=&#34;Heptapod Writing&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an exposition scene that follows, she explains how all scripts on Earth have a sound to character correspondence, while the Alien script isn&amp;rsquo;t phonetic—rather, it represents concepts and their spatial-temporal relationships through various parts of that inkblot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This felt like a major lapse of research on part of the filmmakers. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to go in search of esoteric languages to find one that doesn&amp;rsquo;t use a phonetic writing system. You have Chinese. Chinese characters are not phonetic, and while there is some aspect of sound-character correspondence there, they largely represent concepts instead of sounds, and I would expect any linguist to know this, especially Dr Banks, whose being (at least) conversational in Mandarin is a key plot point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the whole process of figuring out the heptapod language was reasonably well done. Dr Banks overall plan made sense, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t show the execution in any sort of detail (perhaps it would have been too boring). So when you watch her being able to communicate reasonably well with the aliens using an iPad app in just a few minutes of movie time, it does feel a little rushed. Deciphering what the splotches meant, and how various parts worked should ideally have been the toughest part of the challenge because they had little to no data in the beginning, but they more or less bypassed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s often not immediately obvious to lay people what the amount or nature of &amp;lsquo;semantic content&amp;rsquo; in any linguistic utterance is, as shown by the behavior of the top brass. They largely cared only about finding out the aliens&amp;rsquo; purpose on Earth, and had little if any patience for the nitty-gritties of linguistic analysis. I liked how she used the &amp;ldquo;What is your purpose on Earth&amp;rdquo; question to give a quick tutorial in how she&amp;rsquo;d need to build up the semantics of each of the entities in that sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./wp-content/uploads/2016/11/arrival_plan.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Arrival Plan&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that they didn&amp;rsquo;t quite give a reasonable explanation of was why she decided to use written language for communicating instead of trying to understand their speech. There&amp;rsquo;s also the more fundamental question of why the heptapods could not communicate to us in a human language. You can hand-wave it by saying it was essential for them to teach Dr Banks their language (for all the so-called cognitive effects it had) but I don&amp;rsquo;t find that very convincing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-weapon&#34;&gt;Use Weapon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part honestly felt a bit contrived to me. I get that they wanted to tie it in with the whole &amp;lsquo;the same word can have different senses and interpretations&amp;rsquo; thing and how the exact context is necessary to make sense of language, but the conflict between the various nations felt a little unrealistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sapir-whorf-on-steroids&#34;&gt;Sapir Whorf on Steroids&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have discussed the S-W hypothesis in my &lt;a href=&#34;./?p=949&#34;&gt;book review of Guy Deutscher&amp;rsquo;s book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Through the language glass&lt;/em&gt;, but in short, there are a couple of versions of the idea. The strong form insists that a person&amp;rsquo;s thought and cognition is strongly constrained by the language they speak. The weak form claims that the language you speak somewhat affects or shapes your thought process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrival uses a form of the Sapir Whorf hypothesis that is not just strong, it&amp;rsquo;s weapons-grade. Giving not so much a nod as a big giant neon sign pointing towards the S-W hypothesis, they show that as Dr Banks becomes more and more proficient in the heptapod language, it starts drastically affecting her perception of space and time, and eventually trains her mind to see time as some kind of endless continuum. Translated to English, she can essentially communicate with the future, because the future is no longer &amp;lsquo;out there in the future&amp;rsquo;—it&amp;rsquo;s basically part of the same fabric of time or whatever&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strong form of the S-W hypothesis has already been thoroughly dismantled and debunked, so it goes without saying that Arrival&amp;rsquo;s rendition of it exceeds far beyond the realm of what could be considered realistic. I found a great analogy in a reddit discussion that said that Sapir Whorf in linguistics is kinda like faster than light travel in physics. You know that it is not going to work in a &amp;lsquo;grounded in reality&amp;rsquo; kind of way, but the possibilities to speculate about it are endless and very exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get that it&amp;rsquo;s sci-fi and that&amp;rsquo;s fine, but Dr Banks can literally perceive the future, and handling such causality-breaking plot devices in your story is not easy. The scriptwriters here basically chickened out of that responsibility by just not dealing with it when inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you are willing to accept this premise, my biggest gripe is that Dr Banks never actually learns to speak their language! She basically understands the writing system enough to be able to help code up the app to translate what she wants to say in English into their language, but even in the world of S-W on steroids, you&amp;rsquo;d expect that you at least need to speak a language to get its cognitive benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I was reasonably entertained by this movie, including all the linguistic bits, and it was nice that there were no outright ridiculous claims about language. It&amp;rsquo;s also a slightly less conventional take on the aliens-visiting-earth storyline. Not a bad idea to check it out if you think you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy something of this nature.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Book Review: Through the Language Glass by Guy Deutscher</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2016/10/book-review-through-the-language-glass-by-guy-deutscher/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2016 21:58:50 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2016/10/book-review-through-the-language-glass-by-guy-deutscher/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;RVC recently told me about &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Through-Language-Glass-Different-Languages/dp/0312610491&#34;&gt;Through the Language Glass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a book by Guy Deutscher (GD), an Israeli linguist, that is based around the premise of &amp;lsquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity&#34;&gt;linguistic relativity&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;. Ordinarily, hearing those two words together evokes a bit of a fight / flight response in me, so I read the excerpts he sent with some trepidation. I realized that, far from being yet another piece fawning over linguistic relativity, this book actually seemed to be addressing many questions I had about this topic but had never seen properly answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guy Deutscher&amp;rsquo;s primary thesis in this book is that the truth about the influence of language on thought or cognition must lie between the two extremes between which linguistic opinion about this topic has swung over the past century. Now, Guy knows he&amp;rsquo;s going against the tide here, and he goes out of his way to convince his readers that he is not, erm, a crackpot. What results is a book that manages to introduce to the reader some of the saner aspects of the concept of linguistic relativity while also being thoroughly entertaining to read. It&amp;rsquo;s filled with a lot of cheeky humor that sometimes borders on the irreverent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their pronouncements on language, culture, and thought, it seems that big thinkers in their grandes œuvres have not always risen much above little thinkers over their hors d’œuvre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutscher starts with a brief review of the kind of things people have talked about languages and their influence on thought and culture and how they give insights into the minds of the people that speak them. This is despite the fact that some of the fundamental questions of the field are fairly reasonable to ask—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could language have more than a passive role as a reflection of cultural differences and be an active instrument of coercion through which culture imposes its conventions on our mind? Do different languages lead their speakers to different perceptions? Is our particular language a lens through which we view the world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He rightly calls most of this &amp;lsquo;outrageous legacy&amp;rsquo; out for what it is, and criticizes it for driving the whole field to a point where no one will take it seriously—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason why the topic causes such intense embarrassment is that it carries with it a baggage of intellectual history which is so disgraceful that the mere suspicion of association with it can immediately brand anyone a fraud. The problem is that any influence of language on thought is very difficult to prove or disprove empirically, so that the subject has traditionally afforded a perfect platform to those who enjoy flashing their fantasies without the least danger of being caught out by the fact police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first third of this book deals with color terms across languages and millennia. Turns out that when we read books such as Homer&amp;rsquo;s Iliad or Odyssey, the depiction of color terms tends to be, erm, unusual. There is a conspicuous absence of color terms in otherwise very vivid sensory imagery, and the color terms that are there can sound a bit baffling to today&amp;rsquo;s reader. The sea is described as wine-like, for example. Some people proposed that the ability to see color itself seemed to have evolved over the last couple of thousand years, and that the people of those times genuinely didn&amp;rsquo;t perceive colors the way we do now. Think of it like them seeing everything with the saturation slider close to zero, so everything was different shades of light or dark and the hue didn&amp;rsquo;t matter as much. He spends a lot of pages exploring this idea, and later discussing how it was debunked. This part of the book is kind of like an informally written review paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The discussion here is interesting, but it&amp;rsquo;s also kinda anti-climactic. So we know that there is a certain vague sequence (always black, white, followed by red, followed by others) in how languages pick up color words, but we&amp;rsquo;re also fairly sure that we&amp;rsquo;ve been able to perceive color differences all this while, but there doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be any cogent explanation of &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; something as fundamental as color terminology took so much longer to emerge out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular depiction of the speech of tribal people or societies that are otherwise considered primitive shows them as speaking either &amp;lsquo;primitive&amp;rsquo; English (&lt;em&gt;me no speak, want fruit, go go go no come&lt;/em&gt;) or some simplistic sounding language deliberately made to sound ridiculous (&lt;em&gt;hoolaa hoolaa mungobaba&lt;/em&gt;). Ask any linguist, though, and they will tell you—&amp;rsquo;All languages are equally complex&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we have no evidence to believe that any of the 6000-ish languages spoken by humans across the world are what you would consider primitive. So, the average-joe depiction I talked about above does seem clearly incorrect, but there&amp;rsquo;s a huge leap of logic between that and the assertion that all languages are equally complex (ALEC). Do we have reason to conclude that the ALEC principle is indeed true? You&amp;rsquo;d certainly think so, if you were to open any introductory linguistic textbook, or chat with the average linguist over drinks—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This battle cry is one of the most oft avowed doctrines of the modern discipline of linguistics. For decades, it has been professed from lecterns across the globe, proclaimed in introductory textbooks, and preached at any opportunity to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But GD says he has looked for over 15 years for a source that explains this &amp;lsquo;spectacular discovery&amp;rsquo; that has now become an oft-peddled claim in the field of linguistics, but he has failed to find one—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens, the dogma of equal complexity is based on no evidence whatsoever. No one has ever measured the overall complexity of even one single language, not to mention all of them. [&amp;#8230;] The equal complexity slogan is just a myth, an urban legend that linguists repeat because they have heard other linguists repeat it before them, having in turn heard others repeat it earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than the obvious difficulty of defining and evaluating the complexity of a language in a meaningful way, there doesn&amp;rsquo;t even seem to be any prima facie reason to believe that all languages are (or need to be) equally complex. He goes on to talk a bit more about this, and eventually concludes that—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alleged central finding of the discipline is nothing more than a hollow mouthful of air, since in the absence of a definition for the overall complexity of a language, the statement that “all languages are equally complex” makes about as much sense as the assertion that “all languages are equally cornflakes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then moves on to Sapir and Whorf. Whorf&amp;rsquo;s whole spiel about our language fundamentally constraining what we can understand or express was obviously hokum, and brought the field to what GD calls an intellectual nadir, but perhaps there&amp;rsquo;s some useful cargo we can salvage from this academic train wreck?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, any mention of linguistic relativity will make most linguists shift uneasily in their chairs, and “Whorfianism” has largely become an intellectual tax haven for mystical philosophers, fantasists, and postmodern charlatans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comes the Boas-Jakobson principle. Instead of obsessing over what a language allows its speakers to express (anything and everything), we could focus on what it &lt;em&gt;obliges&lt;/em&gt; its speakers to express. For eg. English speakers can often equivocate about the gender of a person (&lt;em&gt;I spent yesterday evening with a friend&lt;/em&gt;) but have no choice but to convey that said time was spent in the past, whereas Chinese does not oblige its speakers to do that. If you think the burden English places on you is high, be thankful that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to learn the language of the Matses, a tribe living in the Amazonian rainforest—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, there are three degrees of pastness in Matses: you cannot just say that someone “passed by there”; you have to specify with different verbal endings whether this action took place in the recent past, distant past, or remote past. In addition, the verb has a system of distinctions that linguists call “evidentiality,” and as it happens, the Matses system of evidentiality is the most elaborate that has ever been reported for any language. Whenever Matses speakers use a verb, they are obliged to specify—like the finickiest of lawyers—exactly how they came to know about the facts they are reporting. The Matses, in other words, have to be master epistemologists. [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Edited to remove parenthetical examples]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the book goes into a bit of depth about a few specific instances of this. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of discussion about the spatial sense of people whose language forces them to use cardinal directions (N, S, E, W) at all times instead of relative positions such as left, right, front or behind. There&amp;rsquo;s another segment where he talks about a study where people had to spot which disc out of a bunch of discs had a different shade of blue on it. In general, the time taken by people to spot the difference depended on the degree of the difference (which is expected), but in case of Russian speakers who have different distinct words for a light and dark shade of blue, it also depended on whether both the shades were in the same color category or on opposite ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I found this to be an interesting read. There are not too many &amp;lsquo;answers&amp;rsquo;, so to speak, but it does manage to raise lots of questions. Oh, and if you have any insight into any of the things I wrote above, do add a comment!&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2016/07/what-should-be-indias-common-script/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of interest in writing systems, which is why you will find a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=44&#34;&gt;lot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=208&#34;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=836&#34;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=775&#34;&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=715&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=244&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; around them. A few years ago, I &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=847&#34;&gt;wrote about the Bharati script&lt;/a&gt;, which was touted as an attempt to create a universal script for Indian languages. I had expressed measured skepticism about the idea, but had also said I would like to see the script, and luckily, was contacted by Chetan Shenoy, an undergrad from IIT Madras, who works under Prof Chakravarthy, the creator of the script. He let me know that the script had now been made public, and can be accessed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biotech.iitm.ac.in/Faculty/CNS_LAB/bharathi_draft2.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (this whole thing happened two years ago but I never ended up writing about it). I would first discuss the script a little bit, and then move on to discussing whether we really need a common script—if you are not interested in the specifics of the script, skip to the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bharati script is a motley combination of symbols largely from Devanagari, Tamil and the Roman script. Prof Chakravarthy had expressed disappointment, and I had agreed [to the facts, not the inference], that despite the scientifically structured ordering of the symbols in Indian scripts, [which shows that the scholars of the past did have cognition of the relevant linguistic facts], the shapes of the letters were unnecessarily arbitrary. This makes sense, because the writing system is more likely to have developed organically, and would have preceded scholarship about the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to rectify this, the Bharati script has a standard mark for aspiration (a dot) and for voicing (a vertical line) that accompanies the symbol of the base form (unaspirated, unvoiced). The root letter for K series is taken from the Devanagari script (minus the vertical bar). Likewise the root letter for the CH row. From here, we move on to Tamil, with the letter for the T row sourced directly from the script used to write Tamil. The next row again moves back to Devanagari (albeit with the vertical line in this case). The root for the fifth row (P) is from Tamil. The corresponding nasals are a bit funny. N and M have been sourced from the Roman script, while the retroflex N is basically the corresponding Devanagari character. The velar and palatal nasals, I can&amp;rsquo;t associate with any Indian script of the top of my head. Y, R and V and S are their English counterparts, while the L is sourced from Kannada. Conspicuously absent is the symbol corresponding to the Tamil ழ or Malayalam ഴ, so as it stands, the name of the Tamil language (தமிழ்) can&amp;rsquo;t be written using this script. I found that a bit surprising, especially as the professor is from IIT Madras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite like Bharati and could go on a bit more about it but I think that misses the bigger point. As I see it, there are three questions here to consider—How much does it matter if the letters of a script are logical? Does India need a new common script? Finally, if we do need one, what should that common script be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s ignore logographic writing systems such as the Chinese Hanzi, or the Japanese Kanji that derives from it. This is not merely a convenient omission, it&amp;rsquo;s a reasonable one, for if your focus is on developing a new script for easy universal adoption, the Hanzi is the last place you&amp;rsquo;d want to look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ignoring Chinese-like writing systems, if you look at prevalent writing systems around the world, you&amp;rsquo;d notice that they are fairly easy to learn. Though they are of a few different types, most have fewer than 100 characters, and the strong relation between sound and writing in most of them make them fairly easy to pick up if you learn the script along with learning the language. Note here that I am talking specifically about the script, not about the spelling system of the language. These differ, and the same script can be used by different languages in different ways. The best example of this is of course the Latin Script, which is used by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_writing_system&#34;&gt;more than 100 languages&lt;/a&gt;. The English spelling system, for instance, is notoriously irregular and difficult to navigate the intricacies and idiosyncrasies of, as I have discussed on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=651&#34;&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=847&#34;&gt;occasions&lt;/a&gt; on this very blog. Spanish, on the other hand, uses the same script, but has a very predictable and regular spelling system, and you can learn to pronounce Spanish words correctly with very little study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closer home, most Indian scripts are also fairly straight-forward, and while we have a lot of them, they are mostly all arranged similarly, and if you really wanted, you could learn all the symbols of a particular script in a few days. If you are actually learning the language along with it, you will retain the knowledge much better and would be able to read faster. Some scripts are extremely easy, such as Tamil, but that is because it has too few characters, and ends up merging all voicing and aspiration distinctions into one, while others are a bit difficult&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these writing systems are relatively easy to pick up, but the shapes of characters in most of them are _not_ motivated by phonetic analyses, and the role phonetics plays in most of them is pretty small, if any. Some do mark phonetic features uniformly&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, but overall, it&amp;rsquo;s still fairly arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is that while regularity in a script&amp;rsquo;s characters is a good-to-have (if you really care about it), it&amp;rsquo;s not a need-to-have when the number of characters is relatively low (less than 100), as is the case with most prevalent writing systems in the world. Given the degree to which these systems are entrenched into everyday life, the motivation for regularizing what&amp;rsquo;s already working well is akin to fixing what ain&amp;rsquo;t broke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the next question. Does India need a common script? Everything else held equal, having a common writing system is of course trivially better than having different writing systems, just like having a language everyone knows is trivially better than having no common language.English-literate people can trivially hop on to learn, say, French, or German, or Malay, for that matter, without having to learn a new script. As I have argued above, learning a script is not that huge of a barrier, but having no barrier is trivially better than having some barrier. I have argued in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=699&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; about how the lack of a common language in India comes with its own set of issues which can&amp;rsquo;t just be romanticized away by diversity arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is after &amp;lsquo;holding everything else equal&amp;rsquo;. People have strong emotional ties with their writing system, scripts are a huge part of the culture of the people who speak it, and then of course there are huge financial costs of changing your entire system to a new one. So, if you are doing it, you better have very very good reason. And for all the millions who are already using the old script, there is scarcely any reason to want to move to a new one&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really really want to switch to a common script for all Indian languages, switch to the Latin one. Yes, I know it&amp;rsquo;s rather drastic, but hear me out. If you are willing to go through, and subject everyone in the country to all this pain just to shift to a new script, you might as well get a LOT of bonus features along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;lsquo;Ambiguity of Latin script&amp;rsquo; is an irrational bugaboo, as I have explained above. Romanization systems for Indian languages are already pretty regular to begin with, and if you are planning to shift, can be standardized completely. It might have to be slightly different for different Indian languages, but that problem will exist with any common script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The whole argument about being sentimental about your own script and culture was presumably thrown out of the window anyway when you chose to adopt a universal script. And if you are going to run it over, might as well use the opportunity to adapt the closest thing we have to a global adoption standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The phonetically motivated ordering of letters in Indian scripts is entirely irrelevant to how the script is used, so nothing is lost in this conversion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indian texts will become much more accessible on the internet, much more easily searchable, your languages becomes more accessible to outsiders and to insiders, you get a largely unified way of spelling things within the country, you end up learning the Latin script for free, so it&amp;rsquo;s easier for people to learn English if they want to. I mean, the possibilities are endless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A bonus with choosing Latin of course is that it helps you bypass all Hindi-Tamil-Whatever squabbles. Even today, it&amp;rsquo;s English that is India&amp;rsquo;s unifying language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To clarify, I am not saying we must change to the Latin script, but that if we are planning to move the country to a common script, we might as well make it Latin. It&amp;rsquo;s a defensible proposition, and worth all the trouble that any such process will entail. And if you are lamenting losing all the beautiful Indian scripts in the process, rest assured that Bharati or any similar attempt is not going to be any different in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;Such as Urdu with the do-chashmi-he for aspiration, Kannada / Telugu with the dot for aspiration (but only in some cases), Hangeul (Korean) with the extra hyphen-esque line for aspiration (in consonants) and for adding a y sound to vowels. Now that I think of it, aspiration seems to be a popular thing to mark using such techniques.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;Bengali tends to go overboard with its conjunct characters (যুক্তাক্ষর, &lt;em&gt;juktakkhôr)&lt;/em&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s tractable nonetheless.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;One of the most famous examples of a culture adopting a new writing system is that of the adoption of Hangeul, the script Korean is written in. But, Hangeul was specifically created because Korean, until then, was written using Chinese characters, which were not accessible to the general population. Hangeul was supposed to be a replacement so that literacy was accessible to everyone, not just the intellectual class.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

          <title>Hindi Cryptic Crosswords</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2015/09/hindi-cryptic-crosswords/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 24 Sep 2015 17:01:36 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2015/09/hindi-cryptic-crosswords/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently set the &amp;lsquo;question paper&amp;rsquo; for the Hindi Word Games General Championship (GC) &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; at IIT Bombay. Here are the links to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.antarikshbothale.com/misc/hindiwg2015.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;question set&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.antarikshbothale.com/misc/hindiwg2015_sol.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;solutions&lt;/a&gt;. As part of the competition, I decided to put in a round of Hindi Cryptic Puzzles. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cryptic Crosswords&lt;/a&gt; are very popular in English, but haven&amp;rsquo;t got much of a traction in the Hindi world. Regular crossword puzzles are fairly common—I remember solving the crossword in the Dainik Bhaskar growing up, but cryptics are relatively unchartered territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crosswordunclued.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Crossword Unclued&lt;/a&gt;, a blog/website that has tons of  resources on Cryptic Crosswords, has released a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crosswordunclued.com/search/label/beyond%20english&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;few Hindi cryptic grids&lt;/a&gt; in the past which I will suggest you check out. They also have an excellent posts about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.crosswordunclued.com/2013/10/setting-hindi-crossword-lessons-learnt.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;lessons learnt&lt;/a&gt; trying to make a Hindi cryptic grid. But other than this, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything substantial on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hindi words are typically smaller in length compared to English ones (I haven&amp;rsquo;t done the Math but I would guess that the average word length is close to or less than half that of English words). Here, I&amp;rsquo;m counting word length in terms of &amp;lsquo;letter chunks&amp;rsquo;, in which diacritics are counted with the base consonant and conjunct consonants are counted as one. This is the standard way of counting for regular Hindi crosswords too, and essentially corresponds to how the words are filled up in the grid. Note that Crossword Unclued calls this as counting the number of syllables in the word, but this is not exactly correct because of Hindi schwa deletion. (eg. मतलब has two syllables, मत and लब, but has a length of 4).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the 12 clues I came up with. I wanted to make a grid, but that would have needed a lot of clues that would then have deserved a higher fraction of the total points, and I wanted to avoid that since it would be unfair to all those who had no prior experience with cryptic puzzles. Plus, making a grid is much more challenging and time-consuming, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have that much time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added a small tutorial in the beginning for those new to cryptics—I chose to call the definition परिभाषा, the clue सुराग and the connector योजक.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the twelve clues (answers after the clues):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;स्मृति से मिलो, दया, वापस जा कर (2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;पुलिस को माल चाहिए तो ये करे, बरामदे से जाए (4)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;दो लोगों का मिलन, ऐसी दशा बना डाली (2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;मस्तानी शाम और आखरी पल, जो ज़िंदगी को रोशन करे (3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;रात के बाद नशे का पहला चिन्ह (3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;धन का अभिप्राय (2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;करजत में पाई जाने वाली धातु (3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ज़्यादा नहीं, काम से निकाला (2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;दो लबों में छिपी ताक़त (2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;सुंदर कहा जा सकता है शायद रावण और ब्रह्मा को (5)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;जैसे की भाजपा और कांग्रेसदोनों कीचड़ हैं (4)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the answers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;योजक&lt;/strong&gt;: —&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;सुराग&lt;/strong&gt;: मस्तानी शाम और आखरी पल&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anagramming with मस्तानी as anagrind, followed by selecting a letter from a word, with आखरी as the indicator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;रात के बाद नशे का पहला चिन्ह (3) &lt;strong&gt;निशान&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;परिभाषा&lt;/strong&gt;: चिन्ह&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;परिभाषा&lt;/strong&gt;: ताक़त&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;योजक&lt;/strong&gt;: —&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;सुराग&lt;/strong&gt;: दो लबों में छिपी&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was kind of a telescopic clue, without directly giving the container&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;सुंदर कहा जा सकता है शायद रावण और ब्रह्मा को (5) &lt;strong&gt;खूबसूरत&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;परिभाषा&lt;/strong&gt;: सुंदर&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;योजक&lt;/strong&gt;: —&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;सुराग&lt;/strong&gt;: कहा जा सकता है शायद रावण और ब्रह्मा को &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably my favorite—it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a pun on &lt;strong&gt;खूब&lt;/strong&gt; also meaning &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; in Hindi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;जैसे की भाजपा और कांग्रेस दोनों कीचड़ हैं (4) &lt;strong&gt;दलदल&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;परिभाषा&lt;/strong&gt;: कीचड़ हैं&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;योजक&lt;/strong&gt;: —&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;सुराग&lt;/strong&gt; जैसे की भाजपा और कांग्रेस दोनों&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a charade, with both components being the same&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;वज़न करके तल डालो (2) &lt;strong&gt;तोल&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;परिभाषा&lt;/strong&gt;: वज़न कर&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;योजक&lt;/strong&gt;: के&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;सुराग&lt;/strong&gt;: तल डालो&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another letter insertion&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were plenty of interesting lessons from the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, due to the word-order being different for Hindi, making a smooth and natural surface while keeping the definition on one end was difficult, since verbs that you&amp;rsquo;d typically use for that purpose would be most natural at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homophone clues are also impossible due to the largely one-to-one correspondence between graphs and phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anagramming is pretty potent, but it probably needs to be formalized a bit more to deal with vowel diacritics, full vowels, conjuncts, nasals etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to face this since I was not making a grid, the presence of conjunct consonants along with vowel diacritics might make it difficult to use these in checked squares (squares common to two clues).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;GCs are inter-hostel competitions which contribute to the inter-hostel points tally for that year for the genre that they are in. The Hindi Word Games GC, for example, would contribute to the Literary Arts which in turn contributes to the Cultural GC.

          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2014/01/pranav-mistry-and-our-problem-with-accents/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Pranav Mistry was one of the speakers at IIT Bombay&amp;rsquo;s Techfest this year. He rose to fame in 2010 for his TED Talk on &lt;em&gt;Sixth Sense&lt;/em&gt;, a wearable gestural interface that augments the physical world around us with digital information and lets us use natural hand gestures to interact with it (Description sourced from his website).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/YrtANPtnhyg&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Since then, he has been in and out of limelight, and has generally been on the receiving end of a lot of (well deserved) love and admiration from Indians, especially because he comes off as a &amp;lsquo;son of the soil&amp;rsquo;. No where is this more obvious than when you hear him speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, when Pranav Mistry announced the Samsung Galaxy Gear as the Director of Research of Samsung Research America, his accent was almost as much a topic of discussion on the internet as the technology he presented. It is true that Pranav speaks in a strong Gujarati accent (some internet sources say it&amp;rsquo;s a Kathiawadi Gujarati accent, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know enough about them to tell them apart), and discussions about Pranav&amp;rsquo;s accent aren&amp;rsquo;t new. He isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly fluent either, so his talks can be quite jarring even otherwise. I did see a few tweets suggesting that the video telecast of his Galaxy Gear presentation should have been subtitled, which is of course a very reasonable expectation, and which I think should be standard procedure for any talk aimed at an international audience, irrespective of the speaker&amp;rsquo;s accent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were several caustic comments on social media about the way he speaks, and counter-tweets to those defending Pranay and also criticizing those who change their accents when they go abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loads of sensible people did raise their voices against the tide of pointless criticism leveled against Pranav&amp;rsquo;s accent. But, among the many who rightly rose in Pranav&amp;rsquo;s defense were people who somehow saw his preservation of his childhood accent as some kind of virtue. Aakar Patel, for instance, wrote an article that criticized those who found Pranav&amp;rsquo;s accent embarrassing, and added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistry is smart enough to make it to the world’s technology elite. And honest and confident enough not to change the way he pronounces words from the way he learnt them in his Palanpur school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging Pranav based on his so-called non-posh accent is wrong, but it is equally wrong to suggest that preserving / maintaining one&amp;rsquo;s native accent is a sign of being true to one&amp;rsquo;s roots, whatever the hell that means, and that not doing so is in some sense selling out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linguistically speaking, everyone has an accent, but in everyday speak, people who sound different from how the rest of the crowd does are usually said to have an accent. Or, occasionally, anyone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t speak the standard / prestige dialect is said to have an accent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a language learning enthusiast, I usually pay keen attention to native speakers&amp;rsquo; pronunciation and try to get as close to it as possible. For me, it&amp;rsquo;s a very happy moment indeed if a native speaker says that I sound almost like them. This works for most foreign languages, but not that much for English, because there&amp;rsquo;s hardly one variety of English&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Indian kids usually grow up learning Indian English, with their native accent superimposed over whatever the local English accent is. Personally, I&amp;rsquo;m usually a sort of accent chameleon, accommodating my speech to that of the listener. So, the way I&amp;rsquo;d speak to a native speaker of American English would be different from the way I&amp;rsquo;d speak to a native Japanese speaker talking in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People take on different accents for a variety of reasons. Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s just to make yourself easier to understand. Or to better assimilate with the group you are in. Or as a natural progression towards native fluency. And sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s just an inevitable result of spending a lot of time exposed to other accents. Some people, however, tend to judge merely the presence of more than one accent as a bad thing, as if one is putting on a mask and hiding their true self. I find it hard to sympathize with such a position. I think there is nothing glorious about adopting a new accent, nor is there anything praiseworthy about keeping yours. It&amp;rsquo;s just a personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is of course one thing if a person goes out of their way to speak in a different accent just to assert superiority or to sound condescending, but adopting accents that suit your audience (or, adopting a relatively &amp;lsquo;international&amp;rsquo; accent which isn&amp;rsquo;t too strongly tempered by regional accents) sounds like a perfectly normal or natural thing to do. It is perfectly fine if Pranav prefers to stick to his native accent, but those who choose otherwise aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily traitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine very recently mentioned how an ex-IITM professor who&amp;rsquo;s now at MIT gave her talk in an Americanized accent, and how it pissed him off, because well, what was the point of her accent when she anyhow clearly looked and was &amp;lsquo;desi&amp;rsquo; (Valley-speak for &amp;lsquo;Indian&amp;rsquo;). I found his anger rather misplaced. After all, she was addressing an American audience, so it&amp;rsquo;d make sense to speak in an American accent. I am sure the same person would speak pretty differently if she was delivering a talk at IITM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, languages and accents are fascinating sources of diversity. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to examine your own, and it&amp;rsquo;s fun to pick up and learn those of people around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;There are multiple varieties of most languages, but English is unique in its tremendous spread and near-first-class status in several countries across many geographies and cultures.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[return]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

          <title>One script to bind them all</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2013/07/one-script-to-bind-them-all/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2013 13:47:23 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2013/07/one-script-to-bind-them-all/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, I came across a few &lt;a href=&#34;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-07-17/india/40634852_1_indian-languages-alphabet-bharati&#34;&gt;news reports&lt;/a&gt; that a professor from IIT Madras (Professor V Srinivas Chakravarthy) has developed a script (called Bharati) to &amp;ldquo;unify 22 Indian languages&amp;rdquo;. As a script-enthusiast, I was of course slightly interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of self-congratulatory rhetoric in India about how Indian scripts are very &amp;lsquo;scientific&amp;rsquo;. On the contrary, the English script (which, in most cases, is the only other kind of script most Indians know) is criticized for being arbitrary, ambiguous, unscientific, what have you. Prof Chakravarthy voices similar sentiments, saying that English is arbitrary and that &amp;ldquo;There is no logic to why A comes first and Z last. Indian scripts are logical.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is indeed true that the arrangement of vowels and consonants in the Devanagari script has a sound phonetic basis. Prof Chakravarthy explains some of it in an interview. There is some hand-waving in the middle, where he calls aspirated consonants stressed and when he uses plosives while listing places of articulation, but he has got the general problem more or less correct. Each row of the first 5 consonant rows corresponds to a place of articulation (starting at velar and ending at labial), while each column represents a combination of aspiration and voicing. The last column represents nasal consonants, and the last two rows contain glides, liquids and fricatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, interesting though all this is, the arrangement of the letters has hardly any bearing on whether or not that script is easy to learn, because the forms of the characters corresponding to the various consonants / vowels are pretty arbitrary. I remember a French friend once remarking that she&amp;rsquo;d found the Devanagari much more difficult to pick up compared to Arabic. I can understand why. One would expect that the Devanagari script, in all its scientific rigor, would have similar glyphs for sounds that share phonetic features, thereby making it easier to learn, but it has no such thing. Speaking of the script used for writing Urdu, it lends some order to the chaos by not having separated symbols for aspirated and unaspirated sounds (such as k / kh, ch / chh etc.), instead using a symbol called &lt;em&gt;do-chashmi-he&lt;/em&gt; (ﮪ) in front of unaspirated consonants to indicate aspiration. For example, _pal_ (moment) in Urdu is written as &lt;strong&gt;پل&lt;/strong&gt; while &lt;em&gt;phal&lt;/em&gt; (fruit) is &lt;strong&gt;پھل&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scripts from Kannada and Telugu also fare marginally better than Devanagari in this respect, where at least a few similar consonant pairs also have similar characters. For instance, aspiration is indicated in a few characters by placing a dot below the unaspirated counterpart. Eg. b / bh (ಬ / ಭ), p / ph (ಪ / ಫ) and d / dh  (ದ / ಧ). Thankfully, Prof Chakravarthy admits to this much—&amp;rdquo;Indian scripts are logical,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;But, they are also unreasonably complicated and ornate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script developed is not in public domain, so I can&amp;rsquo;t offer any comment on it, though the inventor claims it will be easier to learn because it uses similar shapes for similar sounds, and draws from many Indian scripts. However, he wants to patent it, which is weird because his aim was purportedly to  help spread the script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of developing new / better scripts isn&amp;rsquo;t new, and a lot of effort is put into doing so, but with relatively little result, and that is assuming that the thing makes sense to begin with (I had argued otherwise for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=775&#34;&gt;Hinglish project&lt;/a&gt; back in December).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if the concept makes sense, scripts and languages have so much inertia that it&amp;rsquo;s very very difficult to ask millions of people to just drop everything they know so far and pick up something different, no matter how logical or scientific it is. Moreover, script difficulty isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem for the average speaker of a language. Most of them learn the script in school when they&amp;rsquo;re young, and once you know it well, there is no real incentive to change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a post a couple of months ago, I &lt;a href=&#34;./?p=836&#34;&gt;wrote about SayPu&lt;/a&gt;, an attempt to make a common spelling system across languages using the Roman script. Professor Chakravarthy&amp;rsquo;s effort, at least by its description, looks like a much more useful / better one compared to SayPu. His job was of course relatively easier because most of the Indian languages share a large part of their phonemic inventory, but he had to come with new symbols, which the SayPu guy didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I am curious to find out what the Bharti script looks like. I doubt if it will ever be seen beyond its inventor&amp;rsquo;s notepad, but I would love to have a look at it nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2013/02/could-better-science-reporting-standards-at-the-bbc-improve-the-quality-of-their-articles/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I just came across this article on the BBC Website (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21505114&#34;&gt;Could a new phonetic alphabet promote world peace?&lt;/a&gt;) because it was posted in the &lt;a href=&#34;www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics&#34;&gt;/r/badlinguistics&lt;/a&gt; sub-reddit, and for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is such a remarkable mix of bad linguistics and general cluelessness that I would have thought that even with media&amp;rsquo;s generally low standards of science (especially language) reporting, something like this would not have made the cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, I am not sure why they even chose to write a whole article around this SaypU thing. People keep coming up with spelling standards every other day, and SaypU isn&amp;rsquo;t even particularly impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has set up SaypU, an alphabet with none of the indecipherable squiggles of traditional phonetic alphabets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It contains 23 letters from the Roman alphabet as well as a back to front e. There is no place for &amp;ldquo;c&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;q&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;x&amp;rdquo;, which merely repeat sounds achievable by using other letters. The &amp;ldquo;ɘ&amp;rdquo; represents the soft &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo; of &amp;ldquo;ago&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;about&amp;rdquo;, a sound known as &amp;ldquo;schwa&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_None of the indecipherable squiggles of traditional phonetic alphabets &lt;em&gt;is either thoroughly ignorant or thoroughly racist. It is ignorant if they are trying to refer to the IPA, because they fail to appreciate that the reason the IPA needs to have so many symbols is because it has to represent innumerable sounds from languages around the world, something the SaypU dude has conveniently overlooked. And it is racist if they are trying to call every non-Roman script character an &lt;/em&gt;&amp;lsquo;indecipherable squiggle&amp;rsquo;_, as if writing systems around the world are all meaningless just because they aren&amp;rsquo;t A-B-C-D-E. This is particularly ironic because most of these squiggly scripts do a much better job of representing the sounds of their respective languages than that used for English does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, it&amp;rsquo;s slightly unusual that SaypU chooses the ɘ to represent the schwa (the -uh sound). You&amp;rsquo;d think that once they&amp;rsquo;d decided to use a non-English character, they could as well have used the standard symbol for schwa. Hipster much?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simplified universal alphabet would end not only misunderstanding. It would help foster peace around the world, he believes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to come from a person who&amp;rsquo;s never come out of their English bubble, which is rather weird because the inventor has been described as a Syrian banker, so I&amp;rsquo;d assume he&amp;rsquo;d at least be familiar with Arabic. I dunno how SaypU is supposed to represent Arabic sounds, and exactly how it would help even if I could bypass the Arabic script if I didn&amp;rsquo;t know Arabic in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I come from Syria, a place torn apart by war now. The war is not to do with languages but the groups fighting each other do use different pronunciations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t see how any merging of pronunciation (something that a spelling standard, including SeypU cannot achieve anyhow) can help in ending conflicts. Even cultural conflicts, that often include a conflict over language, aren&amp;rsquo;t so much due to differing pronunciations as due to the fact that neither party wants to consider the other&amp;rsquo;s pronunciation as correct, and this is rooted in socio-politics, not linguistics. This is not a problem that can be solved by a universal alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If people pronounce and speak in the same way it makes people feel closer to one another. I do think the world with a single alphabet would be a more peaceful place.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dialects don&amp;rsquo;t exist because of ambiguity in spelling. English spelling is fairly standardized (even the US/UK differences are puny), yet you&amp;rsquo;d find hundreds of English dialect. This is NOT about spellings systems. It&amp;rsquo;s about language variation, which happens independent of orthographic representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think the inventor of SaypU even understands what it means to have a Universal Alphabet. You need a writing system that can (fairly) unambiguously represent sounds from all the languages of the world. The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is the most widely used standard for this purpose. It has over 100 characters and over 50 diacritics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how SeypU is expected to represent any non-English sound with its 24-character set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;rsquo;t always obvious what the correct answer is. The SaypU spelling of &amp;ldquo;top&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo; have had to be tweaked to take into account the different vowel sounds of American and British English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paragraph comes just a few paragraphs after the claim that everyone would start pronouncing words the same way once we had SaypU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SaypU champions simplicity. But because of that it will struggle with languages in the Caucasus which have five or six ways of pronouncing the &amp;ldquo;k&amp;rdquo; sound, and South African languages like Xhosa where clicks play an important role, Ostler says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only Caucasus languages but practically any language that is not English. If they had listened to what Ostler (chairman of the Foundation for Endangered Languages) said, they won&amp;rsquo;t have published the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is only towards the end of the article that they put in counter-views:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a futile aim, says Hitchings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny part is that these views are considered as skepticism. This is like printing an article raving about intelligent design and then printing that a few scientists are &amp;lsquo;skeptical&amp;rsquo; about the whole thing and are suggesting that evolution is possibly a better explanation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Cross-posted on &lt;a href=&#34; http://linguistrix.quora.com/Could-better-science-reporting-standards-at-the-BBC-improve-the-quality-of-their-articles&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Quora&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Orders When Pizza Yoda</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2013/01/orders-when-pizza-yoda/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2013 05:37:58 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2013/01/orders-when-pizza-yoda/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A comic that was doing the rounds a few months ago keeps getting revived every once in a while when it gets discovered by a new bunch of people. The comic shows Yoda ordering pizza over the phone, but unable to get his order across because of his mangled word order. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to not feel pity for the battered Yoda shown in the last frame as he sits biting on a sandwich. If you read that comic, you would get the impression that you turn a sentence into Yoda Speak (let&amp;rsquo;s call it Yodese? or rather, Yodalese) by randomly shuffling its words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/slice.seriouseats.com/images/2011/07/20110719-yoda-pizza.jpg?resize=450%2C585&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s a little more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the things you get from introductory linguistics is that a lot of what is considered random, chaotic or just plain wrong has a lot of regularity and pattern underneath. A very common and popular example is that of African American Vernacular English (AAVE), previously called Black Vernacular English (BVE). Speakers of standard English often believe that BVE or AAVE is just corrupted standard English and you could &lt;em&gt;imitate&lt;/em&gt; a &amp;lsquo;Black accent&amp;rsquo; by arbitrarily omitting some words and mispronouncing some others. However, AAVE has a definite structure and syntax of its own, and any random corruption of English does not generate AAVE, just like arbitrary rearrangement of a sentence &lt;a href=&#34;./2012/04/mere-dil-ka-chain-tere-do-mast-mast-nainon-ke-dwaara-le-jaaya-gaya/&#34;&gt;does not generate passive voice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoda&amp;rsquo;s syntax generally fits in the &lt;em&gt;OSV&lt;/em&gt; word order pattern (Object Subject Verb). Here, &lt;em&gt;O&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need to be an object. It refers to whatever complement follows the verb. &lt;em&gt;OSV&lt;/em&gt; is a very very rare word order in natural languages. However, Yoda also often says sentences that use the standard English word order &lt;em&gt;SVO&lt;/em&gt;. Another way of looking at Yoda&amp;rsquo;s syntax, as posited by Prof Geoffrey Pullum on &lt;a href=&#34;http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002173.html&#34;&gt;LanguageLog&lt;/a&gt;, is to say that Yoda uses SVO but &lt;em&gt;favors, almost to an excess, special constructions that English allows only as stylistic variations in special discourse contexts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moral of the story isn&amp;rsquo;t that Yoda&amp;rsquo;s speech is perfectly regular. It&amp;rsquo;s that even seemingly chaotic language often has a lot of underlying order that we tend to not recognize because we see it through the glasses of our own language. This is something that is particularly useful to keep in mind when we judge languages / dialects other than our own.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>We have App!</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2013/01/we-have-app/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2013 08:10:40 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2013/01/we-have-app/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I saw an Onion &lt;em&gt;Tech Trends&lt;/em&gt; video: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ntPxdWAWq8&#34;&gt;HP Offers &amp;lsquo;That Cloud Thing Everyone Is Talking About&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/9ntPxdWAWq8&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The whole video is funny, but what really cracked me up was when the HP spokesman says, at 1:32, &lt;em&gt;We have App&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evidently, many other people found it funny too—the top comment on the YouTube video makes a reference to that statement, and a quick search I did on Google showed me that this particular line was tweeted and written about quite a bit when the video was launched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I find interesting is how the line &lt;em&gt;We have App&lt;/em&gt; derives its humor value almost entirely from the lack of an article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of articles in English is very complicated. The &lt;em&gt;a/an&lt;/em&gt; issue is straightforward, barring a few special cases, but choosing where to use &lt;em&gt;a[an]/the/(nothing)&lt;/em&gt; can get pretty tricky. Many non-native speakers with an otherwise good command of English betray their non-nativity by the way they use (or don&amp;rsquo;t use) articles. When I proof-read text written by others, I often find almost perfect English, except for the occasional misplaced article. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;d go so far as to say that this is one of the most difficult aspects of the English language to gain a mastery of, especially for speakers of those languages that don&amp;rsquo;t use articles the way English does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most grammar books try to lay down a few (or even many) rules about this, but the subtle nuances that can be introduced by the choice of article are often difficult to &lt;em&gt;explain&lt;/em&gt; to non-native speakers. In general, however, article choice is not a very critical aspect of the language, and it usually just makes you sound a bit &amp;lsquo;funny&amp;rsquo;, usually without impeding communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is precisely what happens in the video above. The problem here is not non-nativity, but the fact that the HP Spokesperson is shown to have no idea whatsoever about what he&amp;rsquo;s speaking, including the meaning of the word App. He seems to think that &lt;em&gt;App&lt;/em&gt; is some kind of thing in itself, such as Cloud Storage or Creativity. If he had said something like &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;We have Apps&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;We have an App&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;, it won&amp;rsquo;t have been half as funny. I find it very fascinating how the omission of one article (or the use of singular &lt;em&gt;App&lt;/em&gt; instead of plural &lt;em&gt;Apps&lt;/em&gt;) creates such a profound impact on the semantics and pragmatics of the sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>WiFi Free</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2013/01/wifi-free/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 03 Jan 2013 07:12:09 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2013/01/wifi-free/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;When I visited the recently opened Starbucks near Horniman Circle, I noticed this on the glass door:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;./wp-content/uploads/2013/01/starbucks-182x300.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The fact that the word &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; has two senses in English is often brought up because the difference in the two senses is sometimes critical/relevant. Especially in the FOSS (Free and Open Software) world, the distinction is often explained as &lt;em&gt;Free as in free speech, not as in free beer&lt;/em&gt;, to disambiguate the two senses: one of freedom and another of not having to pay anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am reminded of a conversation I had with my Japanese friends last year in Tsukuba. One of the girls had recently broken up with her boyfriend whose name meant _Sugar_ in Japanese. I saw a food packet with the text &lt;em&gt;Sugar-free&lt;/em&gt; on it and showed it to her as a joke on her current state, and recall her being a bit confused about this use of the word &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt;. Other related languages usually have two different words for these two senses. In French, you say &lt;em&gt;libre&lt;/em&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;free speech&lt;/em&gt; sense, and &lt;em&gt;gratuit&lt;/em&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;free beer&lt;/em&gt; sense. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=free&#34;&gt;EtymOnline&lt;/a&gt; claims that the sense of _given without cost_ comes from the notion of &lt;em&gt;free of cost&lt;/em&gt;, which invokes the original &lt;em&gt;freedom&lt;/em&gt; sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found it mildly interesting that flipping the order in the phrase &lt;em&gt;X free&lt;/em&gt; switches the sense of &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; being used. When we say &lt;em&gt;free X&lt;/em&gt;, we are using the no-money sense, while X-free implies that we are &lt;em&gt;free of X&lt;/em&gt;, where we use the &lt;em&gt;freedom&lt;/em&gt; sense. Both forms have different syntactical structures. If you say Free WiFi, the whole thing is a Noun Phrase with WiFi as the head and Free as the modifier. On the other hand, a term like Sugar Free is not an NP. It&amp;rsquo;s an Adjectival Phrase with Sugar as the modifier and Free as the head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this particular case, we have the second format being used, but with the first sense. The reader is expected to either read it as &lt;em&gt;WiFi (is) Free&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;WiFi&lt;/em&gt;: _Free_ or probably just see the words WiFi and Free and put 2 and 2 together.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The Hinglish Project</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/12/the-hinglish-project/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 06 Dec 2012 20:28:06 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/12/the-hinglish-project/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I had heard about the Hinglish project back in June when Sindhu shared the link to their website on her status. I had since forgotten about it, only to be reminded of it some time ago when an &lt;em&gt;Incredible India!&lt;/em&gt; video featuring the project was shared by many people on Facebook. The video has over 70000 views now. A few people even pinged me with the link and suggested that I do a Linguistrix post on it. So well, here we go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, have a look at the video:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/pX76E8qRct4&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Hinglish project, by their own admission, worked with the aim of making Hindi characters &amp;lsquo;less intimidating&amp;rsquo;. In order to tell the phonetic sound of a Hindi character, all that a foreigner needed to do was to look at the English letter superimposed on it. Prima facie, this appears to be a good idea, but the more I think about it, the more difficult I find it to actually think of a practical application for the Hinglish Project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basic premise of this project is that it has come up with a Hinglish font that superimposes, on a Devanagari character, an English character whose pronunciation matches that of the Devanagari one closely. But, that&amp;rsquo;s also where the problems begin. First, the direction of transliteration seems to be reversed. The whole point of the Hinglish project is to make foreigners read Hindi, whereas the font they have developed maps 26 English characters to their approximate Hindi counterparts. Have a look at the alphabet of the Hinglish font:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;./wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Alphabet2.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;The Hinglish Alphabet&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Since this alphabet covers only 23 out of the roughly 47 Devanagari characters (I am counting 11 vowels, 33 core consonants and 3 conjuncts), that&amp;rsquo;s half the script left illegible anyhow. But that&amp;rsquo;s still not as big an issue as the fact that this effectively provides a Hindi map of the English alphabet, rather than the other way round. I could imagine it being at least partly useful to someone who wanted to learn the English script. But I don&amp;rsquo;t see how it helps English speakers read Hindi. Surprisingly, almost all the examples on the website of this font put to actual use are &lt;em&gt;English&lt;/em&gt; words or sentences written using this font, which makes no sense, because the purpose of the font is to let foreigners read Hindi words written in Devanagari. One would expect loads of examples of Hindi signboards written with the Hinglish font, but there aren&amp;rsquo;t any, which isn&amp;rsquo;t very surprising when you consider the fact that the font isn&amp;rsquo;t even equipped for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;./wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Alphabet1.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;The corresponding Devanagari letters form gibberish&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The only Hindi word I found written was this one:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;./wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Alphabet3.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is a different matter how someone could go from the letters G and I to the intended pronunciation for गई. That&amp;rsquo;s because this font completely ignores vowels. The obvious reason for this is that an alphabet like that of English has been mapped to an &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;abugida&lt;/a&gt; script like that of Hindi. But by completely ignoring the existence of vowels in the script, the Hinglish project, even if it works, would just give the reader an unpronounceable sequence of English letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if they were able to pronounce them, they would obviously not understand anything, since they&amp;rsquo;d be reading Hindi, but I am ignoring that point here since I assume that this font is aimed at being used for signboards and the like where you&amp;rsquo;d mostly find proper nouns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next issue of course is that of readability. The 2 colour format means that the text would, apart from the gibberish English characters, be difficult to read even in Hindi, and would need special techniques to generate. This renders is rather impractical for actual signboards. In any case, it&amp;rsquo;s not a typeface that I would want to see on all signboards across India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other possible uses of the Hinglish font, though. It could be used in phrasebooks or similar material to help foreigners learn the Devanagari script. But I find it to be of limited utility, considering that the English letters have been force fit in the case of most Devanagari characters, and would be hard to remember as mnemonic aids. More importantly, a book that actually aims at teaching someone the Devanagari script would have to use a more thorough approach that doesn&amp;rsquo;t ignore half the alphabet at the outset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another useful possibility. Instead of forcefully superimposing two scripts on each other, thus creating misleading associations, it would be pertinent to use something like the Japanese furigana. As Wikipedia explains, Furigana is a Japanese reading aid, consisting of smaller kana, or syllabic characters, printed next to a kanji (ideographic character) or other character to indicate its pronunciation. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;./wp-content/uploads/2012/12/kanji.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the above image, the small text at the top indicates the actual pronunciation of the Kanji characters given at the bottom. Something similar could be tried for Hindi, and with considerably better results. Something like:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;./wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Alphabet31.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If someone were to read this, they would get a reasonable pronunciation of my name, and if they saw a few such examples, they would slowly learn to pick up features such as vowel marks and nasal markers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the media buzz that this project gives will partially achieve the aim of the project. From what I&amp;rsquo;ve read, it&amp;rsquo;s won a few awards too. But, from a linguistic point of view, while the Hinglish project seems to be well-intentioned, it falls short by a considerable amount in actually solving the problems it identifies.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Maine Basanti Ko Nahaate Huey Dekha</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/11/maine-basanti-ko-nahaate-huey-dekha/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2012 12:09:53 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;This cartoon appeared today in my Facebook feed:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;./wp-content/uploads/2012/11/gabbar.png?&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m posting it on Linguistrix because it&amp;rsquo;s a rather cute display of syntactic ambiguity, and for a change, it&amp;rsquo;s in Hindi. Syntactic ambiguity is when a particular sentence can be parsed in more than one grammatically correct ways, each with a different meaning. A popular example is &lt;em&gt;I shot an elephant in my pajamas&lt;/em&gt;, which has not two but three parsings—either I was wearing my pyjamas, or the elephant was inside my pajamas, or that the elephant was wearing my pajamas. Note that most speakers, when confronted with that sentence, would tend to choose the most reasonable sounding meaning (that I was wearing pajamas), but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that the other two readings are incorrect. In fact, the shock value introduced by the unnatural parsing is used for humor in the full version of the quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shot an elephant in my pajamas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;how he got in my pajamas, I&amp;rsquo;ll never know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—Groucho Marx, Animal Crackers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the cartoon, it&amp;rsquo;s the modifier &lt;em&gt;nahaate huey&lt;/em&gt; that is the source of ambiguity. It could either confirm Veeru&amp;rsquo;s fears and modify &lt;em&gt;Basanti&lt;/em&gt;, in which Gabbar&amp;rsquo;s in for a visual treat, or it could modify the verb &lt;em&gt;dekha&lt;/em&gt;, in which case Veeru can be at peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Languages are so rife with ambiguities (including semantic) that it would be delusional to imagine that languages are supposed to be or intended to be unambiguous (first of all, no one &lt;em&gt;intends&lt;/em&gt; a language, unless they are sitting down and designing one). Yet, people keep on flogging the dead horse, trying to claim that some constructions are ungrammatical just because they are ambiguous. It is a useful advice to writers that they avoid writing pointlessly ambiguous prose, but that prose does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; become ungrammatical merely because it can have multiple meanings, and it&amp;rsquo;s useful to understand that distinction.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>SciTech Majlis and Arabic Roots</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/09/scitech-majlis-and-arabic-roots/</link>
          <pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2012 14:53:41 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/09/scitech-majlis-and-arabic-roots/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The Society for Promotion for Undergraduate Research (SPUR) recently launched &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;Scitech Majlis&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;: Weekly group discussion session about science and technology. The name gave rise to a bit of buzz because of the use of the Urdu word &lt;em&gt;majlis&lt;/em&gt; (مجلس, मजलिस). When I first heard it, it sounded a bit tone-deaf to me—the two words didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to lend well to compounding, but whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, I am no Urdu expert but I do know of some good places where we can look, and I went to my trusted resource, Platts&amp;rsquo; Dictionary of Urdu, Classical Hindi and English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A مجلس _majlis_ (n. of place fr. جلس &amp;rsquo;to sit&amp;rsquo;), s.f. An assembly, congregation, company, party, meeting; convivial meeting; convention, congress, council, conference;—an assembly of _ṣūfīs_ and dancing dervishes:—&lt;em&gt;majlis-ḵẖāna&lt;/em&gt;, s.m. Assembly-room; town-hall; ball-room:—&lt;em&gt;majlis-ě-raqs&lt;/em&gt;, s.f. A dancing-party, a ball:—&lt;em&gt;majlis-ě-sarod&lt;/em&gt;, s.f. A concert:—&lt;em&gt;majlis-ě-ʻilmī&lt;/em&gt;, s.f. A literary association:—&lt;em&gt;majlis karnā&lt;/em&gt;, To convene a meeting or assembly;—(among Shīʻas) to commemorate the martyrdom of Imām Husain:—&lt;em&gt;majlis-meṅ sharīk honā&lt;/em&gt;, To join an assembly; to attend a meeting:—&lt;em&gt;mīr-majlis&lt;/em&gt;, s.m. The president or head of a society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arabic has a very nifty root system that is central to the way words are formed in that language. Words derive from three (most commonly three) consonant roots based on systematic modifications. Even if you encounter a new word, you can often get close to its meaning simply by identifying the root. Since Hindi-Urdu have loads of words from Arabic, lemme illustrate the root system using words speakers of Hindi would know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The root SH-R-B conveys the idea associated with the English word &lt;em&gt;drink&lt;/em&gt;. Think of Hindi words with this letter combination. Sharaab, shorba, sharbat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take another root, J-H-D, meaning &lt;em&gt;struggle.&lt;/em&gt; Can you think of any words with J-H-D and referring to struggle. Jihad. You may have also heard of the term &lt;em&gt;jaddojahad&lt;/em&gt; (eg. &lt;em&gt;Badi jaddojahad ke baad hamein aazaadi haasil hui hai&lt;/em&gt;). A person who performs the struggle is called a &lt;em&gt;mujaahid&lt;/em&gt;. And the Arabic plural of &lt;em&gt;mujaahid&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;mujaahideen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The examples are countless. S-F-R stands for &lt;em&gt;travel&lt;/em&gt;. A traveller (analogous to the way we made &lt;em&gt;mujaahid&lt;/em&gt;) is&amp;#8230; &lt;em&gt;musaafir&lt;/em&gt;. An embassy is _safaara__. _F-H-M is the root for understanding, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of the Urdu word for misunderstanding, &lt;em&gt;ghalat-fahmee&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K-T-B is the root for &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt;, giving us words like _kitaab__ _and the Arabic word for destiny, made famous by &lt;em&gt;The Alchemist&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;maktoob &lt;/em&gt;(written).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming back to &lt;em&gt;majlis&lt;/em&gt; then. This word is based on the root J-L-S, with the associated meaning of &lt;em&gt;sitting&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Majlis&lt;/em&gt; means a &lt;em&gt;council&lt;/em&gt; or a &lt;em&gt;session&lt;/em&gt;. Other common words with the roots J-L-S are &lt;em&gt;jalsaa&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;juloos&lt;/em&gt;. And Ashish Goel pinged me to point out that the word _Majlis _also appears in the name of a political party in Hyderabad—&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Majlis-e-Ittehadul_Muslimeen&#34;&gt;All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM/MIM)&lt;/a&gt;, meaning &lt;em&gt;All India Council of the Union of Muslims&lt;/em&gt; (کل ہند مجلس اتحاد المسلمين). Apart from the use of the word &lt;em&gt;Majlis&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;council&lt;/em&gt;, note the same plural suffix &lt;em&gt;-een&lt;/em&gt; that was present in &lt;em&gt;mujahideen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next time you see a Urdu word, try to figure out its root and try to look for other words with the same set root. I&amp;rsquo;ve got several epiphanies this way, and I hope you do too.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Vanilla Sex—Female Organs and Aromatic Beans</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;amp;id=2738#comic&#34;&gt;SMBC comic&lt;/a&gt; from a few days ago goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/20120918.gif&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Something didn&amp;rsquo;t seem right about the whole thing but SMBC is usually grounded on at least some fact, so I decided to explore, and it turned out to be more interesting than I had earlier thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the term &lt;em&gt;vanilla&lt;/em&gt; (used to describe the beans) does come from the Latin root &lt;em&gt;vagina&lt;/em&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s not as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Latin, the word &lt;em&gt;vagina&lt;/em&gt; meant just a sheath or a scabbard (kinda makes all those dick jokes funnier, eh). The Latin word wasn&amp;rsquo;t used in an anatomical sense in classical times. As usual, we turn to our friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.etymonline.com/&#34;&gt;EtymOnline&lt;/a&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[vagina (n.)][1] 1680s, from L. vagina &amp;rdquo;sheath, scabbard&amp;rdquo; (pl. vaginae), from PIE *wag-ina- (cf. Lith. voziu &amp;rdquo;ro cover with a hollow thing&amp;rdquo;), from root *wag- &amp;rdquo;to break, split, bite.&amp;rdquo; Probably the ancient notion is of a sheath made from a split piece of wood (see [sheath][2]). A modern medical word; the Latin word was not used in an anatomical sense in classical times. Anthropological vagina dentata is attested from 1908.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Spanish, we get &lt;em&gt;vaina&lt;/em&gt; which comes from the Latin &lt;em&gt;vagina&lt;/em&gt;, and means more or less the same thing—sheath/pod. The diminutive form of _vaina_ in Spanish is &lt;em&gt;vainilla&lt;/em&gt;. The diminutive form of a word is usually a form that expresses a smaller version of the same object. Many languages use diminutive forms as terms of endearment. In Hindi, for instance, you add -u to names to make &amp;lsquo;cuter&amp;rsquo; versions of those names. E.g. Rajiv —&amp;gt; Raju, Nishant —&amp;gt; Nishu, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vainilla&lt;/em&gt; then means &lt;em&gt;small pod&lt;/em&gt;, and this was the word the Spanish and Portuguese explorers chose for the Vanilla bean. This was also used for its scientific name &lt;em&gt;Vanilla planifolia&lt;/em&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s how &lt;em&gt;Vanilla&lt;/em&gt; came to English. And EtymOnline agrees—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[vanilla (n.)][3] 1660s, from Sp. vainilla &amp;rdquo;vanilla plant,&amp;rdquo; lit. &amp;ldquo;little pod,&amp;rdquo; dim. of vaina &amp;rdquo;sheath,&amp;rdquo; from L. vagina &amp;rdquo;sheath&amp;rdquo; (see [vagina][1]). So called from the shape of the pods. European discovery 1521 by Hernando Cortes&amp;rsquo; soldiers on reconnaissance in southeastern Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to note that, although &lt;em&gt;vanilla&lt;/em&gt; does indeed derive from the Latin &lt;em&gt;vagina&lt;/em&gt;, it has nothing to do with the female reproductive organ of the same name, because it evolved with the &lt;em&gt;sheath/pod&lt;/em&gt; meaning all through. In the meanwhile, the same Latin term got co-opted into English for referring to the sexual organ, this time having nothing to do with fragrant beans. Putting it all together—&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;./wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Vanilla2.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s another interesting thing here: how the SMBC comic changes the head of the modifier &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt;. Even if we take &lt;em&gt;vanilla&lt;/em&gt; to refer to the sexual organ, the diminutive form would imply that it means &lt;em&gt;little vagina&lt;/em&gt;. However, when the character in the comic summarizes &lt;em&gt;Vanilla Sex&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;em&gt;a little vaginal sex&lt;/em&gt;, it makes &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; modify _sex_ instead of &lt;em&gt;vagina&lt;/em&gt;, giving it the sense &lt;em&gt;a bit of vaginal sex&lt;/em&gt;, instead of &lt;em&gt;sex with a small vagina&lt;/em&gt;, which is what &lt;em&gt;vanilla sex&lt;/em&gt; would technically mean if it were indeed derived the way SMBC claimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the main premise—the term &lt;em&gt;vanilla sex&lt;/em&gt;. It is clear that &lt;em&gt;vanilla&lt;/em&gt; here refers to the ice-cream flavor, and again, EtymOnline confirms—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning &amp;ldquo;conventional, of ordinary sexual preferences&amp;rdquo; is 1970s, from notion of whiteness and the common choice of vanilla ice cream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of the word &lt;em&gt;vanilla&lt;/em&gt; as an attributive modifier meaning &lt;em&gt;plain / commonplace / whatever you would typically expect / without any additions / bare minimum&lt;/em&gt; is fairly common, and refers to the ubiquitous vanilla flavor of the ice-cream that is often used as a base flavor. I did a quick search for &lt;code&gt;vanilla [n*]&lt;/code&gt; (which would search for the word &lt;em&gt;vanilla&lt;/em&gt; followed by a noun) on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/&#34;&gt;Corpus of Contemporary American English&lt;/a&gt; (referred to affectionately as COCA) and I am listing a few varied examples of &lt;em&gt;vanilla&lt;/em&gt; used in the sense I discussed—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sense that you had a feeling that somebody thought you were this sort of middle class &lt;strong&gt;vanilla&lt;/strong&gt; girl, and you needed to break free of that image (1998)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good, high cheekbones, a kitteny little nose, playful blue eyes — a &lt;strong&gt;vanilla&lt;/strong&gt; princess through and through. (2011)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have what I consider a very &lt;strong&gt;vanilla&lt;/strong&gt; personality. I just show up and do my thing. (2007)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they supply the only red glare in a show that otherwise reduces a war to a &lt;strong&gt;vanilla&lt;/strong&gt; pageant. (2009)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reel looks nice but delivers a &lt;strong&gt;vanilla&lt;/strong&gt; performance. (2010)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;With a plain &lt;strong&gt;vanilla&lt;/strong&gt; name like Jones, you got ta have a first name that&amp;rsquo;s special,&amp;rdquo; she&amp;rsquo;d said (2007)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s an NGO,&amp;rdquo; Mr. Murphy said. &amp;ldquo;Just your plain &lt;strong&gt;vanilla&lt;/strong&gt; NGO that does aid work.&amp;rdquo; (2005)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, IIT Bombay calls its basic BTech curriculum (without Minors, Honors or any other courses above what is mandatory) a &lt;em&gt;vanilla curriculum&lt;/em&gt;. As any IITian would attest, it rarely involves vaginas, small or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The Do You Mind Trap</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/09/the-do-you-mind-trap/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 24 Sep 2012 05:55:23 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/09/the-do-you-mind-trap/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I was browsing a website on my phone using the &lt;em&gt;Dolphin&lt;/em&gt; browser when a prompt came up. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t take a screenshot, so I am paraphrasing what the prompt said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to improve this application, would you mind giving your experience a star rating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below the question were two command buttons&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No | Rate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;Uh-0h&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rsquo; I said to no one in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When someone asks me something by phrasing it in the &lt;em&gt;Do You Mind&lt;/em&gt; form, it&amp;rsquo;s often an invitation for trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the &lt;em&gt;Do you mind&lt;/em&gt; is a request that you do something, in which case you can just do whatever&amp;rsquo;s requested and get it over with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you mind passing the fork?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;pass the fork&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other cases, it&amp;rsquo;s meant to seek permission for the speaker to do something, in which case it gets slightly tricky:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you mind if I smoke?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically, it&amp;rsquo;s just a Yes/No question. If you are fine with the smoke, say &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;, else say &lt;em&gt;Yes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, if you just say &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s interpreted as a &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt; for the action instead of &lt;em&gt;the minding.&lt;/em&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s probably because the asker is ultimately looking for an answer to their original proposition and the &lt;em&gt;do you mind&lt;/em&gt; part comes out subconsciously due to politeness, introducing a confusing layer of negation which they don&amp;rsquo;t account for in the post-processing. The same problem happens if you answer &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;. Combine it with ambiguous Indian head-waving/nodding and it&amp;rsquo;s enough to flummox foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you really do mind, and want to convey that, a simple and forceful &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt; sounds rather blunt and rude, and you might not want to say it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you mind if I smoke?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;awkward silence&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, people manage such situations by saying neither &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt; nor &lt;em&gt;No&lt;/em&gt;, instead saying something that explicitly conveys what they want and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you mind if I leave?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I don&amp;rsquo;t mind) No problem/sure, go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I mind) Err, I would rather you wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you mind if I smoke?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I don&amp;rsquo;t mind) No problem/sure, go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I mind) Err, I would rather you not. Could you go out instead? Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

          <title>Thank God It’s Jummabar</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/09/thank-god-its-jummabar/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 23 Sep 2012 03:10:43 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/09/thank-god-its-jummabar/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;You know that politics (and its reporting in the media) in your country is hitting a new low when they take Mamata Bannerjee and then criticize her for a &lt;a href=&#34;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Jummabar-Mamata-gives-many-in-north-India-a-new-word/articleshow/16498570.cms&#34;&gt;silly linguistic foible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She threatened to pull her men out of the union on &lt;em&gt;Jummabar&lt;/em&gt;, leading to hue and cry not over the pulling out but on her choice of word—&lt;em&gt;Jummabar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TOI has been kind enough to give us a quick Urdu lesson about the Urdu word for Friday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Urdu word &amp;lsquo;Jumma&amp;rsquo; is derived from the Persian &amp;lsquo;Jomeh&amp;rsquo; and Arabic Jumu&amp;rsquo;ah, which means the &amp;lsquo;day of gathering&amp;rsquo; or the day of the congregational prayer. Which is Friday when attending the afternoon prayer, says the Haadith, is mandatory for all able-bodied Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mamata added a &amp;ldquo;bar&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Jumma&amp;rdquo; — as some do in West Bengal — as in &amp;lsquo;Itwar&amp;rsquo; (Sunday), possibly not just for the local flavour but also for Bengal&amp;rsquo;s Muslim voters who went with Didi in the last election and whom the lady has been wooing steadfastly. Breaking of ties with &amp;lsquo;secular&amp;rsquo; Congress might have got them worried and &amp;lsquo;Jumma-bar&amp;rsquo; was probably designed to reassure them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, thousands of Muslim voters would suddenly feel comfortable voting for TMC because their head said Jumma-bar. Pfff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news article then has quotes from clerics and Imams about how this grave linguistic error is a sign of dire things to come. Because suppression of free speech and democracy and incarceration of anyone who didn&amp;rsquo;t agree with you apparently wasn&amp;rsquo;t. It also goes on to say how &lt;em&gt;even Bollywood&lt;/em&gt; got it right in the song &lt;em&gt;chumma chumma de de&lt;/em&gt;. Between a native Bengali speaker and Bollywood, who do you expect to get it right anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linguistically, the error she made is pretty trivial. Since she is Bengali, her language engine expects all day names to end in -bar and systematically over-corrected the term &lt;em&gt;jumma&lt;/em&gt; so as to make it fit the standard template. I have heard many people say &lt;em&gt;jeans-pant&lt;/em&gt; for jeans. Such mistakes happen &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt; when people talk in a language that isn&amp;rsquo;t their native tongue. Such mistakes do tell us a lot about how the brain handles language (a computer would never make that error as long as it was told that Jumma meant Friday), but unfortunately, it gives us no insight whatsoever into Didi&amp;rsquo;s politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could attempt to explain how irrelevant and pointless this whole issue is, but I could never do justice to its pure, unadulterated irrelevance and pointlessness. So I&amp;rsquo;ll shut up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Hat tip to Mayur Ramteke for the post idea)&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Cabinet Ministers’ Linguistic Skills</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/09/cabinet-ministers-linguistic-skills/</link>
          <pubDate>Fri, 21 Sep 2012 05:37:51 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/09/cabinet-ministers-linguistic-skills/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is about a piece of news that&amp;rsquo;s more than a year old, but I am posting it now because 1. Linguistrix didn&amp;rsquo;t exist back then, and 2. the post is relevant in light of my &lt;a title=&#34;The double-edged sword of India’s linguistic plurality&#34; href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=699&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;recent post&lt;/a&gt; on India&amp;rsquo;s linguistic plurality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This comes from the days when the Jan Lokpal Movement was in full swing and there were talks and discussions between Team Anna and the government on an almost daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In came &lt;a href=&#34;http://tehelka.com/story_main49.asp?filename=Ws110611POLITICS.asp&#34;&gt;this news&lt;/a&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramdev’s Hindi letter exposed Union ministers’ linguistic skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a cabinet committee sat to discuss his deal to end fast, it found no minister could read the letter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a team of Central ministers returned from Claridges Hotel in Delhi after negotiating with Baba Ramdev for five hour on 3 June, they handed over a document signed by Acharya Balkrishna to finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, which was to be discussed at the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA) later that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the horror of Mukherjee, nobody at the CCPA could read the document, which was a handwritten note in Hindi. The CCPA was called to discus the political course on Ramdev’s fast at the Ramlila Maidan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the letter that none of the ministers present could read:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;./images/letter-baba-ramdev.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The media made a minor hue and cry about the issue of Union ministers having such poor &lt;em&gt;linguistic skills&lt;/em&gt;. Now, if you have been a regular reader of Linguistrix, you&amp;rsquo;d have noticed that I have often bemoaned (in rather unequivocal terms) the lack of even elementary linguistics knowledge in most of the world&amp;rsquo;s educated masses. Linguistic ignorance manifests itself in many ways and in many occasions, but this is definitely not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at the members of the committee that had to face the ignominy of not knowing how to read this barely legible Hindi scrawl, and look at their mother tongues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pranab Mukherjee―Bengali&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;P Chidambaram―Tamil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A K Antony―Malayalam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S M Krishna―Kannada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manmohan Singh―Punjabi/Urdu (He was born in the village Gah, now part of Pakistan. From what I have read, the speeches he gives in Hindi are actually written down in the Urdu script because he is much more fluent in that script)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk of diversity!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of posts ago, in I &lt;a href=&#34;https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/09/the-double-edged-sword-of-indias-linguistic-plurality/&#34;&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt; how there was no easy solution to the problems that India&amp;rsquo;s linguistic plurality causes, and how those who make it a fight against English are to some extent scapegoating it. Here, you have an example of someone communicating in a language that is NOT English, that is perfectly Indian, that is considered by many to be the Indian language closest to being universal in the country, with the result that no one understands him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the ministers in that list can probably converse comfortably in Hindi, and I do not see why they should be expected to read handwritten Hindi. I am sure they are all literate in their respective mother tongues, be it Kannada or Tamil or whatever. After all, wasn&amp;rsquo;t that the point of India&amp;rsquo;s linguistic diversity?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the letter, My God, heaven knows it&amp;rsquo;s illegible. I can read Hindi perfectly fluently and I still had to pause at quite a few places to figure out what the hell it said. If this were a handwriting test, it would have barely gotten passing marks. As someone who has put in plenty of effort into learning scripts, I can attest that reading someone else&amp;rsquo;s handwriting in a script that you are not very comfortable with can be very very difficult. You need to have had a lot of practice reading and writing a particular script before you can read handwritten stuff fluently. And when it&amp;rsquo;s written in such an indecipherable scrawl, you will probably need a fair bit of context too before you can extract meaning out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep saying that while English may have had received favorable treatment post India&amp;rsquo;s independence, it ultimately just fills in the job description of a language that can be used by people from various states to communicate with each other. Good luck finding a common Indian language for India without setting the country on fire.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Coalgate and Snowclones</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/09/coalgate-and-snowclones/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 19 Sep 2012 19:22:05 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;As the government faces the aftermath of another scam, the name with which media is referring to that scam is of some linguistic interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indian Coal Allocation Scam is being widely referred to as &lt;em&gt;Coalgate&lt;/em&gt;, a variation on the Watergate scandal with the added punny bonus of it sounding the same as a popular toothpaste brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Watergate scandal, apart from leading to then president Richard Nixon&amp;rsquo;s resignation, became immortal when &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scandals_with_%22-gate%22_suffix&#34;&gt;countless scandals&lt;/a&gt; around the world began getting named after it, all ending in -gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that while the -gate in Watergate had nothing to do with any scandal, the suffix -gate used in subsequent scandal names is meant to convey the meaning of a scandal by alluding to the original Watergate. In a word such as Coalgate, the -gate ending has no relation with an actual gate, and functions only as a reference to Watergate, and could be interpreted to imply a scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a derivation is called a snowclone. Wikipedia defines it as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;snowclone&lt;/strong&gt; is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neologism&#34; title=&#34;Neologism&#34;&gt;neologism&lt;/a&gt; for a type of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clich%C3%A9&#34; title=&#34;Cliché&#34;&gt;cliché&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrasal_template&#34; title=&#34;Phrasal template&#34;&gt;phrasal template&lt;/a&gt; originally defined as &amp;ldquo;a multi-use, customizable, instantly recognizable, time-worn, quoted or misquoted phrase or sentence that can be used in an entirely open array of different variants&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term snowclone was coined by Glen Whitman and Geoffrey Pullum and alludes to the myth regarding Eskimo words for snow,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Eskimos have N words for snow, then surely the X have M words for Z&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a popular rhetorical trope that has permeated journalism, management, and academia in general, and is often used to imply that a particular group X has reasons to keep thinking about Z. The whole enterprise is funny, because, not only is the conclusion wrong (more terms for a word need not imply that the culture thinks about that object all the time, nor is the reverse true), but even the original premise on which it was based is wrong (the Inuit language does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have a large number of snow words).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;re loads of other examples of snowclones. The -core suffix used in many metal genres also behaves like a partial snowclone morpheme (I say partial because -core continues to hold part of its original sense of central/essential). Phrasal templates such as _X is the new Y, The first rule of X is that you do not talk about X_ are all snowclones. If you find such stuff interesting, do check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://snowclones.org/&#34;&gt;Snowclones database&lt;/a&gt;, which has a huge collection of snowclones, many of which you will find familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>New Verb: Toolder</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/09/new-verb-toolder/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2012 04:41:27 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/09/new-verb-toolder/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while in human history comes a time when a semantic gap needs to be filled; when a word needs to be born to take on the responsibility it was destined to. A day shall come when lexicographers would lay their pens to rest and take a well deserved retirement. That day is not today. Today, we create a new word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toolder &lt;/strong&gt;[verb, transitive]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pronuncation: ˈtul.dɚ (tool-duhr), ˈtul.də (tool-duh)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To skip reading something because it is too long. eg. &lt;em&gt;He sent me his thesis but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have too much time so I had to toolder it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To skip doing a task because it seems to require too much effort. eg. &lt;em&gt;You could toolder it all you want, but ultimately it&amp;rsquo;s you who&amp;rsquo;s going to have to finish it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Etymology: From the popular internet abbreviation TLDR, meaning &amp;ldquo;Too Long, Didn&amp;rsquo;t Read&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.londonderrynh.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/the_lion_king_cartoon-5070.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/09/the-double-edged-sword-of-indias-linguistic-plurality/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot has been said and written about India’s linguistic diversity and about our love for the English language. I have seen Indians being described as slaves of the British or slaves of the English language. I have heard them being accused of harbouring an absurd fascination (/fetish) for English. Not content with attacking Indians for their weird fascination for foreign imports, people then continue on to dissing English, calling it backward, stupid, regressive, and a dozen other adjectives that aren’t even defined over the domain of languages as far as linguistics is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For once, I agree that the problem exists, is real, and is serious enough, but it hasn’t got as much to do with English itself as it has with India’s double edged sword of linguistic plurality, which is proving itself to be more of a liability than an asset. As a linguiphile, it’s rather hard for me to say this, of course, but I see no way out of the mess that we are in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true that imposition of a non-native language as the prestige language and the language of all commerce leads to a country’s own citizens without knowledge of that language to become marginalized, second-class citizens. It reduces their productivity in the society, leads to under-utilization of their capabilities, and leaves a vast pool of talented and intelligent citizenry unused and wasted. It also causes this stupid association of intelligence and capability with knowledge of English, as if it is not possible to be smart in any language but English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I see no easy solution. As long as knowledge of English is mandatory for access to higher education and well-paying jobs, English will continue to be a prestige language. And unless there is a common national language (it is clear that it would be unfair to declare Hindi or Tamil as the common language; but some language has to be the common language), some language will take over that role, and that language, for us, is English, equally foreign to all of us. A friend once suggested that instead of English, Sanskrit should be chosen as the common language. I don’t see how choosing one arbitrary foreign language (I use foreign to mean non-native here) as the common language instead of another arbitrary foreign language will solve any problems, except stoking nationalist egos. In fact, if I had to choose between the two, I would go with English purely for practical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could treat each state like a mini-country, making the majority language of the state the official one. School education would have to be in that language, you will need to have top quality institutes of higher education in each state offering degree courses in that language. Likewise, you will need a talented pool of teachers and professors to run who have themselves been educated in the same language. But this is likely to cause problems when people would want to move from one state to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could instead have a North-South divide, with North Indian states working with Hindi, which is still practical, but fixing a common language for South Indians states would still be a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing is clear. It makes little sense to make it a fight against English. It is possible that English got larger than its fair share of encouragement after India’s independence, but I am not sure if things would have unfolded significantly differently even if English didn’t have the head start it did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard quite a few radical ideas, but I am yet to see any practical, reasonable, non-crazy solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Squeezing babies and cutting steel</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/09/squeezing-babies-and-cutting-steel/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 04 Sep 2012 15:20:38 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/09/squeezing-babies-and-cutting-steel/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago, I saw the Olive Oil/Baby Oil meme resurfacing on Facebook. For those not familiar with it, it shows the image of a rather shocked looking baby with the caption &lt;em&gt;If olive oil is made of olives, then&amp;#8230; what is baby oil made of?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;./images/olive-oil-baby-oil.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My heart goes out to the baby, because compound nouns in English can be very very tricky. There is no standard form for interpreting the meaning of a compound noun X-Y. In &lt;em&gt;Olive Oil&lt;/em&gt;, the first refers to the source of the oil, while _Baby Oil _clearly isn&amp;rsquo;t produced by squeezing babies. Note that this is not something can be solved purely analytically. You need to use real world knowledge, or common sense, or intuition, or whatever to resolve the meaning. For instance, a &lt;em&gt;bread knife&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;rsquo;t made of bread, and a _steel knife _will probably not cut through steel. A &lt;em&gt;steel cutter&lt;/em&gt;, though, is mostly something that can be used to cut steel. A &lt;em&gt;kitchen&lt;/em&gt; knife, on the other hand, is neither made of a kitchen nor can it cut through one._ _It turns out that children find it pretty difficult to parse compound nouns and often go for a wrong meaning. For the life of me, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out for long what exactly &lt;em&gt;cutting chaai&lt;/em&gt; meant (Thanks to Anasuya for this example). In fact, compound nouns, often with 4 to 5 nouns piled on top of each other, are regularly employed by newspapers to condense news matter into typical headlinese. It&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to read headlines with noun stacks like &lt;em&gt;Sarojini Nagar Midnight Murder Trial Verdict.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, Linguistrix turns one year old. It&amp;rsquo;s been a great journey, and I have always enjoyed posting on this blog. I know that posting frequency has reduced in the past few months, but I will try to raise it and bring the blog back to how it was earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few things planned for celebrating Linguistrix&amp;rsquo;s birthday. First off, I am doing an AMA about linguistics and languages on Reddit. I will keep answering questions the whole day. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z67s8/iama_hobby_linguist_ama_about_languages_and/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Do check it out.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will post other stuff when it gets ready.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Prescriptivists try Zoology</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/07/prescriptivists-try-zoology/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 11 Jul 2012 14:45:24 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/07/prescriptivists-try-zoology/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, there was this joke that I often read in one of those magazines for children (I think it was &lt;em&gt;Champak&lt;/em&gt;). It was rather lame, but I realized a few days ago that it presented a rather nice analogy of the raging debate between prescriptivism and descriptivism that goes on in academic circles (about language) and so I present an adapted version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, two friends (a prescriptivist and a descriptivist) are walking inside a forest, when they suddenly realize that a fierce looking lion has been stalking them and looks like it&amp;rsquo;s about to attack them. Knowing that they would be easily outrun by the lion, the descriptivist says to the other—&amp;rdquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s quickly climb up a tree. I have read in a book about lions that they can&amp;rsquo;t climb trees. We&amp;rsquo;ll just climb up and wait for it to to go away.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prescriptivist replies—&amp;rdquo;Wait. YOU have read the book. But are you sure the lion has read that book?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linguistics is descriptive, which means that it attempts to describe languages and analyze them as they are. Dictionaries and good grammar books, likewise, are descriptive, in that they attempt to reflect language usage. That&amp;rsquo;s the reason dictionaries need to be continuously updated. Word senses change, new words are made, and old words adopt new meanings. Thus, when I say that &amp;ldquo;The boy was having lunch&amp;rdquo; is correct in Standard English while &amp;ldquo;The boys was having lunch&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t, it&amp;rsquo;s not because your grammar book says so; It&amp;rsquo;s because that is how English speakers speak, and hence that is what is reflected in a good grammar book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In school days, language is synonymous with having to learn grammar rules and doing seemingly pointless transformations (convert a complex sentence into a compound sentence, or convert to/from passive voice, or insert appropriate clauses etc). What this also does is convey the impression that language is about correctness. Nobody&amp;rsquo;s denying that a language has utterances that are grammatically correct, and others that aren&amp;rsquo;t, including some of dubitable grammaticality (Prof Geoff Pullum prefers to call them &lt;em&gt;correctness conditions&lt;/em&gt; in his brilliant essay &lt;a href=&#34;http://people.ucsc.edu/~pullum/MLA2004.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ideology, Power, and Linguistic Theory&lt;/a&gt;). But these correctness conditions need to be derived from actual observations about language usage, instead of pontificating about how sentences shouldn&amp;rsquo;t end in prepositions or begin with conjunctions, or how infinitives should not be split, &amp;lsquo;rules&amp;rsquo; which are never systematically observed in the works of respected authors from any period, nor in everyday communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inability of lions to climb trees isn&amp;rsquo;t a consequence of this being declared in a zoology book. On the contrary, the zoology book gets it content from the zoologist&amp;rsquo;s observation of how lions really behave. And when dogs behave in slightly different ways than wolves despite being related to them, no one considers that incorrect. But when English exhibits behavior dissimilar to Latin, prescriptivists get uncomfortable, or, to use the phrasing Eminem used in his great song &amp;lsquo;Cleaning Out My Closet&amp;rsquo;—they get their panties up in a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In every scientific field, observable facts are given a lot of importance. When a chemist expects a green colored compound on mixing two reagents and gets a red one instead, he goes back to his books and tries to figure out what went wrong. And if an astronomer suggested in a conference that the reason his data didn&amp;rsquo;t match with his predictions was that there was something wrong with the universe, he would be asked what he had been smoking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real-world observation, then, is the basis of any scientific inquiry, and any description of any field would be considered inaccurate if it didn&amp;rsquo;t match with what actually exists. This is not a democratic issue then, nor is it a question of authority. It&amp;rsquo;s not a place where &amp;lsquo;every opinion is valid&amp;rsquo;. It is about being faithful to the world that you are trying to describe. Instead of a million people signing a petition that apples shouldn&amp;rsquo;t fall from trees, the million should invest that time in investigating why apples behave this way, because apples will continue to drop to the ground with impunity whether they like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prescriptivists would do well to remember this the next time they doubt lions&amp;rsquo; ability to climb trees based on whether those lions have read a book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I have no idea whether lions can or cannot climb up trees. Nothing said about lions in this article should be taken as an assertion of fact. Linguistrix is not responsible for any injuries or accidents that may occur as a consequence of your having used the contents of this post to decide the best way to tackle a lion.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The mess that is the English spelling system</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;The latest XKCD &lt;a href=&#34;http://xkcd.com/1069/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reads&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/imgs.xkcd.com/comics/alphabet.png&#34; alt=&#34;Alphabet&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part is a reference to the cheesy pick-up line &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;If I could rearrange the alphabet, I&amp;rsquo;d put U and I together&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The irregularity of the English spelling system is part of folk-lore now. You have countless poems and articles and whatnots, all trying to hammer in the fact that English pronunciation is the work of the Devil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;English wasn&amp;rsquo;t always this way. Let&amp;rsquo;s travel through time to the 14th century and listen to a recitation of the General Prologue to Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer in Middle English. Note that no one who&amp;rsquo;s alive today has heard Middle English being spoken, but this seems to be a reasonable reconstruction. Notice how the spellings of the words aren&amp;rsquo;t significantly different from what we have in Modern English, but the pronunciation is so markedly different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;embed-youtube&#34; style=&#34;text-align:center; display: block;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wiki page for English Orthography summarizes the situation well: &lt;em&gt;This is largely due to the complex history of the English language, together with the absence of systematic spelling reforms implemented in English, in contrast to the position in a number of other languages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it in short, the pronunciation has undergone significant changes, some very systematic ones (The Great Vowel Shift), but the orthography hasn&amp;rsquo;t followed suit. So what was once pronounced as it was written now sounds very different from its spelling. For instance, the word _I_ wasn&amp;rsquo;t pronounced &lt;em&gt;Aye;&lt;/em&gt; it was pronounced &lt;em&gt;ee&lt;/em&gt;, the way you would expect in a &lt;em&gt;speak as you spell&lt;/em&gt; language. The &lt;em&gt;gh&lt;/em&gt; in night wasn&amp;rsquo;t silent, it was actually pronounced. And the &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; in night wasn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;aye&lt;/em&gt;, it was &lt;em&gt;ee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from this, there is the whole issue of loan words. English usually just retains the spelling of the loan word and modifies its pronunciation slightly, while still retaining a bit of the original. When there are loan words from all kinds of languages, you are bound to have a lot of mess. You are effectively borrowing words which have been written using completely different spelling conventions. So you have words like Czech and Fjord. When there are too many conventions, there isn&amp;rsquo;t any convention at all. That, my friend, is English. Of course, with enough experience, you do begin to see patterns in English words, and can often predict the spelling of a word with reasonable accuracy, but it is true that our orthography remains a veritable mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Mark Liberman wrote on Language Log, &lt;em&gt;the English writing system is a complex pattern of overlapping historical layers with sporadic intrusions of reform, for which the appropriate mode of analysis is more geological than logical. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While English orthography is indeed a colossal mess (and no linguist would claim otherwise), there are some bright sides to it once you manage to get over the terrible spelling. Often you can tell where a word has come from merely by looking at it, because it carries a signature of its original language. The letter _ch_ pronounced as &lt;em&gt;sh&lt;/em&gt;? It&amp;rsquo;s probably come via French. The same letter pronounced as &lt;em&gt;k&lt;/em&gt;? We are mostly looking at a gift from the Greeks. And so on&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I hope you&amp;rsquo;ve seen this excellent video!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;embed-youtube&#34; style=&#34;text-align:center; display: block;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/06/so-the-hindustan-times-printed-my-letter-but/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;About a month ago, I wrote an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=617&#34; title=&#34;Open letter to the Hindustan Times&#34;&gt;open letter to the Hindustan Times&lt;/a&gt; in which I criticized their Sunday columnist Karan Thapar for often putting together his columns based on boring email forwards full of banalities. It was almost as if his grandson (assuming he has one) wrote those columns based on whatever the funniest joke in his kindergarten class was. I say this because I think it was around 1st standard that the &amp;lsquo;P.U.T. is pronounced _put_ but B.U.T is pronounced _but&amp;rsquo;_ joke ceased to be funny. Not content with this, he followed it up with not one but eighteen examples of homonyms, in an attempt to demonstrate that English spelling and pronunciation are ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mailed my letter to the Hindustan Times, not expecting it to be published. Surprisingly, they printed it next Sunday. I was in Japan that weekend, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to read it, and then forgot about it. It was only when an acquaintance mentioned reading it that I was reminded of it. Most of what I wrote had been condensed to make it sound more spiteful. Anyhow, what I found rather amusing was that, while they had shortened and edited my sentences, they replaced the word _linguists_ in my original letter to &lt;em&gt;linguistic scientist&lt;/em&gt;, a phrase that is not only longer, but is also significantly rarer in use. In fact, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.co.in/search?sugexp=chrome,mod=0&amp;amp;ix=h9&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=&#39;linguistic+scientist&#39;#q=%22linguistic+scientist%22&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;prmd=imvns&amp;amp;ei=L93UT-3xGofwrQfPg638Dw&amp;amp;start=10&amp;amp;sa=N&amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;amp;fp=497a2fd8e4d4d504&amp;amp;ix=h9&amp;amp;biw=1366&amp;amp;bih=667&#34;&gt;Google search&lt;/a&gt; for _linguistic_ _scientist_ returns only 37000 results, and almost all the results on the first few pages are irrelevant. In short, no one really uses the term &lt;em&gt;linguistic scientist&lt;/em&gt;. I have no idea why they did that, but I presume it&amp;rsquo;s because they think linguistics is a flaky profession full of fluff, and perhaps putting &amp;lsquo;science&amp;rsquo; somewhere there would help improve its credibility. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I will use this platform to convey to the small handful of people who read Linguistrix—Linguistics is the scientific study of human language, and linguists are people who engage in this study.

          <title>Don’t Incentivize Word Rage</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/06/dont-incentivize-word-rage/</link>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Word Rage is a common phenomenon that particularly affects the intellectual community, whose members apparently can&amp;rsquo;t convince themselves of their intellectuality unless they swear bodily harm against people who use words they don&amp;rsquo;t like or misplace apostrophes or other sundry stuff. It also serves as a classic ad-hominem tactic—if you can&amp;rsquo;t find any sensible counter-argument to someone&amp;rsquo;s claims, criticize his spelling or usage instead and pat your back for a job well done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word rage also takes another form. In this, it&amp;rsquo;s about specific words irritating the life out of people. Why they dislike these words is never known, but dislike for a word is usually dislike for the people who use those kinds of words, and it&amp;rsquo;s the poor language that gets to bear the brunt of this animosity. A popular punching bag, for instance, is the corporate world, what with its reputation of spewing out &amp;lsquo;corporate bullshit&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I answered a question on Quora about the word &amp;lsquo;incentivize&amp;rsquo;, which joins words such as &amp;lsquo;impactful&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;leverage&amp;rsquo; in the long list of words people seem to hate for no particular reason. While I answer for the specific case of incentivize, my comments also apply to word rage for other similar words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.quora.com/There-is-a-lot-of-debate-over-the-word-incentivize-Do-you-prefer-to-use-it-or-a-simpler-term&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;There is a lot of debate over the word &amp;ldquo;incentivize.&amp;rdquo; Do you prefer to use it or a simpler term?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Words don&amp;rsquo;t become &amp;lsquo;non-words&amp;rsquo; because of collective hatred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s surprising how intellectuals in our society, most of whom are rational, sensible, logical human beings (in short, &lt;em&gt;not morons&lt;/em&gt;) not only engage in word-rage, they also encourage it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand what goes on behind this linguistic fascism, where people try to impose their personal prejudices over the entire populace without a shred of anything that comes even close to a reasonable argument.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incentivize is a legitimate, bonafide word, made from very standard derivational morphology. It&amp;rsquo;s first known use goes back to 1970, according to M-W, so it&amp;rsquo;s not a very recent creation of the corporate world either. It has a sufficiently unique meaning[1]. The –ize suffix is one of the most productive suffixes in English, and is regularly used to make verbs (terrorize, fossilize, sterilize—not a day would pass without you using an –ize verb). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the same suffix for another similar word, and we have word-haters going rabid all over the internet. If you hate the corporate world, if you are part of the 99% (or whatever else it is that fills you with rage over incentivize), say that. Don&amp;rsquo;t blame a harmless word that is a legitimate product of a standard morphological process. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like it, don&amp;rsquo;t use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;strong&gt;_&lt;/strong&gt;____&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] Don&amp;rsquo;t claim that you can replace it with another word. It&amp;rsquo;s not for you to decide what words others wish to choose to express themselves. I can change  &amp;rdquo;rather than&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;instead of&amp;rdquo; and preserve the meaning but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I will declare all instances of &amp;ldquo;rather than&amp;rdquo; as wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Adapting your speech for non-fluent speakers</title>

          <description>&lt;p id=&#34;__w2_tITxAPJ_answer_user&#34;&gt;
  I recently answered a question on Quora that is also relevant for this blog, so I am posting it here.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.quora.com/Manners-Etiquette/When-speaking-to-someone-who-does-not-seem-to-be-a-fluent-English-speaker-should-I-dumb-down-my-diction-and-vocabulary-or-is-that-condescending-and-presumptuous&#34;&gt;When speaking to someone who does not seem to be a fluent English speaker, should I &amp;ldquo;dumb down&amp;rdquo; my diction and vocabulary, or is that condescending and presumptuous?&lt;/a&gt;{#__w2_mw0UOKH_link}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very easy to make your speech easier to understand to the listener without &amp;lsquo;dumbing&amp;rsquo; it down. Humans anyhow unconsciously accommodate their speech &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.quora.com/Manners-Etiquette/When-speaking-to-someone-who-does-not-seem-to-be-a-fluent-English-speaker-should-I-dumb-down-my-diction-and-vocabulary-or-is-that-condescending-and-presumptuous&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; to suit their listener. I consider myself an accent chameleon and do it all the time when talking in English. The exact degree of accommodation depends on the listener. Easy and polite ways to make your speech more accessible to your listener who&amp;rsquo;s not fluent in English are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;__w2_tITxAPJ_answer_content&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div id=&#34;ld_z89kPD_44&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div id=&#34;__w2_GZw8rH1_inline_editor_content&#34;&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
          Reduce the use of idiomatic but non-literal expressions and replace them with straight-forward ones: Instead of &lt;em&gt;What&#39;s up?&lt;/em&gt;, say, &lt;em&gt;How are you?&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
          Tone done your vocabulary: Trade nuance for simplicity. The guy doesn&#39;t know&lt;em&gt;demonstrate&lt;/em&gt;? Use &lt;em&gt;show&lt;/em&gt;.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
          Rephrase: If the listener can&#39;t understand what you said, rephrase it into a completely different sentence structure. Remember that when people are new to a language, they tend to interpret every sentence rather atomically, piecing together meanings of words they know and fitting them into known constructs. Instead of repeating the sentence that wasn&#39;t understood, recast it into a different construct. Remember that as a fluent speaker, you can handle the language with much greater ease.
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;
          If the listener can&#39;t understand a particular word at all, change your pronunciation to their&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;pronunciation. Say you are in Japan and you just can&#39;t make them understand &lt;em&gt;Apple&lt;/em&gt;, it might be better to repeat it as &lt;em&gt;Appuru&lt;/em&gt;, the way a Japanese speaker would say the word. This happens most with people who&#39;ve had little or no exposure to the native pronunciation of the language, and have learnt either from other speakers with the local accent or from books.
        &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;
        Condescension is often conveyed by the tone you use. If you continuously appear exasperated and behave as if the worst part of the world&#39;s troubles has been allotted to you, you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; annoy your listener. Also, unnecessarily simplifying your speech although the listener can understand pretty comfortably is insulting. Take a second or two to gauge the level of the listener and start somewhere there. If they seem to be doing fine, raise the level. If they seem to be struggling, lower it down. For instance, I sound pretty natural and fluent when talking in French, so French people start with the easy mode but quickly switch to &#39;normal mode&#39; when chatting with me and often say that they don&#39;t need to put in any effort while talking to me, which is to say they don&#39;t need to actively accommodate their speech for me.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;
        Also, and this is most important for English speakers, always be appreciative of the fact that a foreigner is making an effort to speak your language, instead of walking around the world arrogantly expecting that it should be everyone&#39;s fundamental duty to know your language.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      
      &lt;p&gt;
        [1] &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_accommodation_theory#Speech_accommodation_Theory&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/w&lt;wbr&gt;iki/Com&lt;/wbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Hindustan Times,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will jump straight to the point. Why does Karan Thapar get to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/KaranThapar/Under-a-spelling/Article1-854883.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fill precious center-page real estate&lt;/a&gt; of the Sunday newspaper with content found in boring &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.co.in/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=The+bandage+was+wound+around+the+wound.The+farm+was+used+to+produce+produce.The+dump+was+so+full+that+it+had+to+refuse+more+refuse.#hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=%22The+bandage+was+wound+around+the+wound.%22&amp;oq=%22The+bandage+was+wound+around+the+wound.%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g-K1g-mK1&amp;aql=&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0i30j0i5i30.21.1338.1.1665.3.3.0.0.0.0.320.569.0j2j0j1.3.0...0.0.Lr0muaRVz14&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=a4dd55b6d0b50073&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;email forwards&lt;/a&gt;? I mean, I know it&amp;rsquo;s your editorial decision and all, but I had expected that you&amp;rsquo;d give more value to your Sunday center-page, otherwise filled with useful and interesting content. You know, if you want your readers to read fascinating and funny stuff about the English language taken from the Web, I would suggest reprinting any of &lt;a href=&#34;http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Language Log&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; posts instead of the mindless drivel that you let KT write just because, well, he&amp;rsquo;s KT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is of course the third time in the past year that Karan Thapar has used his center-space page to deliver quality content about the English language to his jaded readers. In a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=189&#34; title=&#34;Let us speak our Inglish&#34;&gt;post back in November&lt;/a&gt;, I had discussed in detail the lame claims made by him about English and Hindi and his fascination for the &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt; property of a sentence which I showed is shared by every sentence of English and Hindi (and countless other languages). The only consolation is that this time, his claims are mostly factually correct, which I suppose is due to the fact that 80% of &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; article is basically content taken directly from _funny_ mails/SMSes about how English spelling and punctuation are confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, HT, there are innumerable linguists out there who are probably working for a pittance and who actually know a thing or two about language. Give them a fraction of the money you pay to your center-page columnists and they will regale you with fascinating nuggets of information about languages. Or, you could even send a mail to antariksh@linguistrix.com and I can whip something up for you. I promise it won&amp;rsquo;t be material rehashed from silly email forwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;A pic was shared like crazy on Facebook in the last few weeks—&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;./wp-content/uploads/2012/04/actpass1.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This comic is factually incorrect, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good demonstration of how most people are confused about what actual Active and Passive voice is, and mostly just assume it to be random rearrangement of words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the comic, the teacher asks the students to give examples of Active Voice and Passive Voice. The smartass kid replies with two lines from the song _Tere mast mast do nain_ from the movie Dabangg, thereby also complimenting his teacher&amp;rsquo;s eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s enough in this comic to make it viral, and viral it became, so I thought I would write a post about the actual grammatical stuff at work here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin with, it has nothing to do with Active or Passive voice. The song lines demonstrate rearrangement (in this case, fronting) of the Verb Phrase. There&amp;rsquo;re multiple rearrangements here to suit the meter and rhyme, but the two lines are contrasted by the fronting of the entire Verb Phrase &lt;em&gt;mere dil ka chain le gaye&lt;/em&gt;. The canonical word order would be—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tere do mast mast nain mere dil ka chain le gaye.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The position of the object &amp;lsquo;chain&amp;rsquo; has been changed and it&amp;rsquo;s been sent to the end of the sentence to get the Verb Phrase &amp;ldquo;mere dil ka le gaye chain&amp;rdquo;. This entire phrase is then fronted and placed in the beginning, to get&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mere dil ka le gaye chain, tere mast mast do nain&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this has nothing to do with the Passive Voice. The song lyric in Passive Voice would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Mere dil ka chain tere do mast mast nainon ke dwaara le jaaya gaya&amp;rdquo;, which is decidedly unromantic.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Is mediaphobe a word? Notes from the PAF</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/04/is-mediaphobe-a-word-notes-from-the-paf/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2012 18:06:21 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/04/is-mediaphobe-a-word-notes-from-the-paf/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s PAF (Performing Arts Festival) raised an interesting linguistic issue—what makes a word a word?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the PAF, Rajiv Gandhi&amp;rsquo;s character was called a &lt;em&gt;mediaphobe&lt;/em&gt; since he was scared of facing the media. He retaliated, in almost a childishly innocent manner, by saying that _mediaphobe_ wasn&amp;rsquo;t even a word and so he couldn&amp;rsquo;t be called one. He went on to say that he couldn&amp;rsquo;t _be_ a mediaphobe for the same reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be clear to any one that any arbitrary sequence of sounds can&amp;rsquo;t be considered as a _word_ of a given language. For instance, if I were to call someone a &lt;em&gt;shankle&lt;/em&gt;, they would certainly be right in saying that _shankle_ isn&amp;rsquo;t a word and that my assertion had no semantic content. Sure enough, _shankle_ isn&amp;rsquo;t found in any dictionary either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the task of determining what counts as word is not as easy as whipping out your favourite dictionary and checking whether it contains that word. We frequently form new terms by adding commonly used suffixes to commonly used words. Many of these terms aren&amp;rsquo;t found in dictionaries. Also, compositional phrases (such as &lt;em&gt;third city&lt;/em&gt;) don&amp;rsquo;t usually get a place into the dictionary, unless the composition has an idiomatic meaning different from what can be derived from the individual parts (such as &lt;em&gt;third world&lt;/em&gt;, which does exist in dictionaries).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_-phobe_  is a highly productive English suffix that, when combined with a noun X, makes a noun denoting a person who is afraid of X. Note that this suffix can be added to an infinite number of nouns, and it is impossible to list all of them in any dictionary, whether printed or online. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t of course mean that dictionaries don&amp;rsquo;t have words of the form [*phobe]. If you search on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.onelook.com/?w=*phobe&amp;ls=b&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OneLook&lt;/a&gt; for the pattern [*phobe], you get around 80 results, but one glance at those words will tell you that the first part of most of those words comes from Greek or some other language and is not analyzable in English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mediaphobe&lt;/em&gt;, then, is a perfectly legitimate construction of English. Today&amp;rsquo;s dialogue wasn&amp;rsquo;t even the first instance of the same. If you Google for the term, you will get a few previous uses too. And of course, whether someone is something or not has nothing to do with whether there exists a single lexicalized term for the same.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Hermione teaches Shakira: It’s Rabiósa, not Rabiosá</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;When you combine an awesome Harry Potter reference with Spanish phonology, you get a winner. This has got to be the funniest thing I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in the recent past:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/a1.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/389638_376441275710576_230440226_n.jpg?resize=400%2C311&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;
  Since this is Linguistrix, let me add a few lines about the points of linguistic interest in this gag.  Spanish pronunciation is delightfully easy and predictable with a very regular spelling system. Words usually have only one stressed syllable, and it is the last syllable, except when the word ends in N or S or a vowel, in which case it&#39;s the penultimate syllable (Michel Thomas calls this rule the &lt;em&gt;Nose Rule&lt;/em&gt;). If the pronunciation of a word deviates from this rule, an acute accent is put on the stressed vowel. For instance, the word &lt;strong&gt;inglés&lt;/strong&gt; (English) is pronounced with the stress on the last syllable (in defiance of the Nose Rule).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;
  The word &lt;strong&gt;rabiosa&lt;/strong&gt;, in the delightful song of the same name sung and performed by Shakira, is therefore pronounced with a stress on the &lt;strong&gt;o&lt;/strong&gt; (which is not indicated in the spelling, since it follows the Nose Rule). Note that the first panel of the gag &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; to mark the accent on the &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; because it goes against the Nose Rule, while it doesn&#39;t need to mark it in the second panel but has been put there so that people get the joke.
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span class=&#34;embed-youtube&#34; style=&#34;text-align:center; display: block;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span class=&#34;embed-youtube&#34; style=&#34;text-align:center; display: block;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

          <title>The critical mass of goodness</title>

          <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
  The country was galvanized last year by the whole Jan Lokpal Movement, and a lot was said for and against the movement, its leaders and cheerleaders, and the thousands of Indians who poured into the streets in the largest display of public outrage in recent times.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we are all fashionably outraged at the way politicians misuse public money with impunity, a small look at the way we lead our daily lives is enough to show that what happens in the order of millions of rupees is just a bigger manifestation of a phenomenon that is integral to our everyday life. We readily pay money to cut corners; we regularly try to cheat the system and feel proud of it. Worse still, we rationalize most of it by telling ourselves that this is all because the system is corrupt—as if multi-million dollar scams in Delhi force us to ask our kids to lie to the ticket-collector about their age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that, in India, it’s incredibly unfair to expect otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the public transport in Germany (and many other countries) works on a self-help basis. You buy tickets and punch them yourselves; if you are carrying pets or bicycles, you buy tickets for them as applicable. There are no ticket-collectors in most trains, nor are there any turnstiles or other setup for verification of tickets. There are occasional spot-checks in trams and buses, but they are few and far between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to skip buying tickets when simple probability tells you that the expected value of cheating the system is in your favour. Why buy tickets then? To feel that you are doing the right thing? The problem is that doing the right thing can make you feel incredibly stupid. What matters is not whether there are enough ticket-collectors, but whether there are enough commuters around you who buy tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the case of a guy who is given a fail grade in a course merely because he didn’t attend enough classes. His friends, who attended fewer lectures than him, have managed to pass through because they asked someone to sign the attendance sheet for them. Alternatively, imagine a student who gets a lower grade than the rest of his class because no one else find anything wrong in cheating in a take-home examination. Or think of the guy who keeps a chocolate wrapper in his pocket while everyone else throws theirs out of the bus window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day, we were standing at one side of a busy road in South Bombay, and were waiting for the pedestrian light to go green. There was a brief period when the road was relatively empty and the vehicle nearest to us was about a hundred metres away. If you wanted to, you could run across the road while the pedestrian light was still red. That’s exactly what everyone did. I hesitated for a second, saw that everyone else in my group had reached the middle of the road, lost the battle with myself, and sprinted. A friend, noticing my hesitation, looked at me incredulously and said—‘oh, you follow traffic rules?’ before quickly adding—‘nahin, matlab acchi baat hai’ &lt;em&gt;(no no, I mean, that’s a good thing)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before punishing wrong, it’s important to foster a culture where people recognize the wrong. Computer Science students of IIT Bombay learn, right in their second year, that there won’t be any tolerance for plagiarism/cheating/copying of any form, and that punishment would be meted out to both the guy who copies and the guy who wilfully gives his assignment to be copied. Most other departments, on the other hand, are remarkably lax about copying in assignments, and turn a blind eye to even the most blatant instances of the same. They thus foster a culture where copying is not only acceptable, it’s actually desirable. It’s a culture where not letting others copy your assignment brands you as anti-social and unfriendly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key then to ensuring goodness is that people who want to do good stuff not be made to feel incredibly stupid for being nice. This is where the critical mass comes in. Once enough people are good, the good ones don’t feel stupid. Once enough people are good, the rest won’t be able to rationalize their badness by referring to collective corruption. Once enough people are good, it would be a nice thing to be good, instead of a stupid thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every once in a while, we hear news reports of a public officer’s life being ruined because he was caught taking a paltry sum as bribe (sometimes as low as INR 300). It’s fun to make sport of such people and to make them face public ignominy. It works beautifully—the ‘higher ups’ can give themselves a pat on the back for ‘exposing corruption’ and punishing it. The holier-than-thou common man who has been taught to feel victimized by corruption smells some kind of sweet revenge. We now have a suspended police officer, and a nation that feels slightly better. Perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you foster a culture of corruption and then arbitrarily punish a few offenders, you are not being &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; in punishing corrupt people, you’re being irresponsible. The movie ‘Shaitan’ ended with this dialogue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;सच और सच्चाई में फर्क होता है. हर पुलिस वाले का धर्म है कि वह निःस्वार्थ भाव से इस देश की सेवा करे. लेकिन सच्चाई यह है कि साढ़े-आठ हज़ार की तनख्वाह में देश संभालो, घर संभालो, या ईमान संभालो&amp;#8230; माँ की आँख हो जाती है.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Paraphrased translation: it’s every policeman’s duty that he serve his country with selflessness. But when you try to take care of your nation, of your family, and of your conscience with a salary of INR 8500… you get fucked up)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s just hope that we can give every policeman and every law-abiding citizen in this country the critical mass of good he needs.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>A ton of tons</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/03/a-ton-of-tons/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2012 10:24:48 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/03/a-ton-of-tons/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This Friday, Sachin Tendulkar completed 100 international cricket centuries and did something that would have been considered impossible by many—prevent millions of Indians from realizing that the new budget is going to make prices rise even more. He also gave everyone an excuse to come up with all kinds of puns involving his name and the word &lt;em&gt;Ton.&lt;/em&gt; I wonder if someone&amp;rsquo;s said &lt;em&gt;Ton Ton Gopaal&lt;/em&gt; yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t follow cricket all that much—I mean, I do watch a couple of matches a year to justify my Indian citizenship, and I keep track of big events such as this one, but that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much all. But I&amp;rsquo;ve always been confused by the word &lt;em&gt;Ton&lt;/em&gt;. To me, it always meant 1000 kg, so I wondered why 100 runs were called a ton, especially when there was a term _quintal_ used for 100 kgs. The Wikipedia page for the word _ton_ is pretty long and interesting. You have the metric tonne, the short tonne, and there are a dozen other kinds of tons based on what you are talking about.  It turns out that this unit has a pretty long history, and means so many different things in different fields that I get the impression that for every quantity, there exists some part of the world where the word _ton_ is used to denote it. And it&amp;rsquo;s also used colloquially to refer to 100 of a given unit, which explains how a century in cricket is called a ton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would think it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make much of a difference, as people would be able to figure out from context. 1½ years ago, in the mid-semester examination for the Machine Design course, we were asked to design a coupling that could take an axial loading of 1 ton. I was pretty sure that 1 tonne meant 1000 kg, but this was the conversation that ensued between three people of our department—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OL: 1 tonne kitna hota hai? &lt;span style=&#34;color: #800080;&#34;&gt;[How much is 1 tonne?]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RK: 100 kgs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VJ: 1000000 kgs hota hai &lt;span style=&#34;color: #800080;&#34;&gt;[It&amp;rsquo;s 1000000 kgs]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RK: Kya fart hai&amp;#8230; toh Tendulkar 100 marta hai toh kyu bolte hai ton mara&amp;#8230;? &lt;span style=&#34;color: #800080;&#34;&gt;[What the fuck? In that case, when Sachin hits a 100, why do you say that he hit a ton?]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly enough, the ones who interpreted 1 ton as anything other than 1000 kg lost a lot of marks on that question, Sachin&amp;rsquo;s tons notwithstanding. They learnt it the hard way, but I hope other don&amp;rsquo;t have to. Students, don&amp;rsquo;t get so swayed away by the tons of puns that are doing the rounds, and remember that a tonne is almost never equal to 100 kgs.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The Chutiya Community and Etymological Notes</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/03/the-chutiya-community-and-etymological-notes/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 14 Mar 2012 04:17:12 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/03/the-chutiya-community-and-etymological-notes/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may have read, Facebook has &lt;a href=&#34;http://ibnlive.in.com/news/facebook-blocks-chutiyas-is-twitter-next/238851-11.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;attracted the anger&lt;/a&gt; of—and I swear there is no other way to put it—the Chutiya community from Assam by blocking many Facebook profiles which mentioned Chutiya as their last name. This is of course a bit ironic coming from a company who&amp;rsquo;s CEO&amp;rsquo;s sister is named &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/pages/Randi-Zuckerberg/181656281865250&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Randi&lt;/a&gt; (Hindi insult meaning &lt;em&gt;prostitute&lt;/em&gt;), but let&amp;rsquo;s not digress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know Hindi, _Chutiya_ is an expletive that means _fool/idiot_ but is pretty offensive and insulting. As I noted in &lt;a title=&#34;Suarez, Evra and Racial Insults&#34; href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=387&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Suarez, Evra and Racial Insults&lt;/a&gt;, the use of expletives is fairly common among friends and those in the same social hierarchy, but this doesn&amp;rsquo;t render them toothless or inoffensive. The name of the Chutiya community, however,  is apparently pronounced as Sutiya (the initial consonant is not the palatal stop [c] but the voiceless alveolar fricative [s]), so you have another victim of arbitrary romanization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mass-blocking is unfortunate, but it is clearly a simple mistake on FB&amp;rsquo;s part and I am sure that this is not part of any conspiracy against that community, and it definitely doesn&amp;rsquo;t warrant burning effigies of Facebook (though I am curious as to how that was done—did they burn an effigy of the homepage? or of the logo? or of Zuckerberg?). Facebook merely insists that people use their legal name on their profiles, so once a systematic request is made to FB, I am sure they will remove the block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How you spell and pronounce your name is always a big problem in India, something I discussed in detail on &lt;a title=&#34;Pronouncing proper nouns, like a boss!&#34; href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=208&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; previous &lt;a title=&#34;Poshchim Bongo&#34; href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=44&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;occasions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing stops anyone from spelling a name the way they want, but it might make sense to tweak the spelling of your name so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t clash with well-established words used that you might not want to associate your name with. So, if you stay in a country where a large number of people would associate your name with an expletive, you are still within your right to spell it the way you want, but it might be of pragmatic value for you to spell it differently. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a question of who is &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. The romanization system that we follow in India is so  chaotic that it&amp;rsquo;s often not even possible to define &lt;em&gt;correctness&lt;/em&gt; in that domain. Everyone can stick with the names they want, such as Indians with the surname &lt;em&gt;Boob&lt;/em&gt;, or the surname _Lund_ (Hindi equivalent of dick/cock), but they are likely to spend their lifetime being on the receiving end of tiresome jokes and jibes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, by the way, since we are on the topic of the word &lt;em&gt;chutiya,&lt;/em&gt; I have something interesting about the meaning of this word. Read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to assume that &lt;em&gt;chutiya&lt;/em&gt; developed as the female counterpart of &lt;em&gt;launda&lt;/em&gt; (one who has a &lt;em&gt;lund&lt;/em&gt; [penis]) which means _guy/dude._ I expected that _chutiya_ would mean&lt;em&gt; one who has a vagina&lt;/em&gt;, possibly used in a pejorative sense. I assumed that it might have originally been used as an insult for guys who were effeminate/sissy, and that it slowly changed into its current meaning—stupid/foolish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All was well until someone at IIT claimed that _chutiya_ meant &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;one born out of a vagina&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;, and that he couldn&amp;rsquo;t be called _chutiya_ since he was born by Caesarean section. I thought this was hogwash—most expletives of this kind usually assert something offensive, whether it be claims of incest or of promiscuity or be it rude references to next of kin. Being born out of a vagina is the default situation, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out how it could be insulting in any way. Surprisingly, however, even &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=chutia&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Urban Dictionary&lt;/a&gt; mentions this meaning. It was all hazy until I decided to look in &lt;a href=&#34;http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/platts/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Platts Dictionary&lt;/a&gt; of Urdu, Classical Hindi and English, one of the best works of its kind. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at what Platts has to say about this word:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
  H چوتيا चूतिया &lt;em&gt;ćūtiyā&lt;/em&gt; [&lt;em&gt;ćūt&lt;/em&gt;, q.v.+Prk. इओ=S. इकः], s.m. &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000ff;&#34;&gt;One who lives on the earnings of his wife&#39;s prostitution; a term of abuse, a blockhead, dolt&lt;/span&gt;:—&lt;em&gt;ćūtiyā-paṭait&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ćūtiyā-ćakkar&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ćūtiyā-ćampaʼī&lt;/em&gt;, s.m. A blockhead, a fool:—&lt;em&gt;ćūtiyā-shahīd&lt;/em&gt;, s.m. A cully, a dupe;—(slang) a man who kills himself by excess of venery, a martyr to venery.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes much more sense to me, and I am prepared to believe it. _Chutiya_ does, in some sense,  mean _out of the vagina_ but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t refer to the process of childbirth, but rather refers to &lt;em&gt;earning out of the [wife&amp;rsquo;s] vagina&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Languages never cease to be fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

I choose to include such posts on the blog because I find the topic to be of significant intellectual/academic interest.]&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harish showed me an interesting article. It talks about 10 food items from around the world which are considered delicacies in their respective areas, but which would be perceived as highly disgusting by people from almost everywhere else, even the most battle-hardened non-vegetarians. In that list are things like maggot-infested cheese and bat-paste, enough to make the toughest of us squeamish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, the highest court of the country spent the last month discussing whether Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (the word Penal there never fails to amuse me, and it&amp;rsquo;s particularly funny when you are discussing 377), which criminalizes unnatural sexual activity, is constitutional, or, as I like to put it, &amp;ldquo;whether it makes any fucking sense&amp;rdquo;. [Update (12 Dec 2013): The Supreme Court finally announced its verdict on this case after almost 2 years, choosing to discard the verdict of the Delhi High Court and reestablishing the constitutionality of Section 377]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people seem to feel that Section 377 is about homosexuality, but it’s not. While one obvious implication of the law is indeed that gay people are harassed by the police (not that you need to be gay to be harassed by the police; being a rape victim works just as well if not better), the law basically criminalizes instances of consensual sex based on whether they are against the ‘order of nature’. Countless people have pointed out that several &amp;lsquo;acceptable&amp;rsquo; heterosexual activities can also technically be penalized under the ambit of 377, so wide and &amp;lsquo;general&amp;rsquo; is this Neanderthal law. Here, I assume that most people don&amp;rsquo;t seem to mind anything as long as it goes on between a man and a woman behind closed doors after they have delivered the stipulated number of babies for the rest of the family to busy itself with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how do you define &amp;lsquo;natural&amp;rsquo; anyway? Is wearing clothes natural? A lot of animal species have sex forcibly. Does that make rape natural and correct? Male members of many species often fight to death to win a female. Does that make killing for love natural? The black widow spider eats its mate after sex. Would Mr. P P Malhotra, the Assistant Solicitor General who passionately spoke about nature, advise that human females follow suit? The law of nature dictates that inferior beings be removed from the gene pool in the most brutal demonstration of winner-takes-it-all. Does that mean that we shouldn’t make efforts to make lives easier for disabled people because nature doesn’t seem to care much about them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hopelessness of using nature as an argument to justify or refute anything is so absolute that it is surprising that &amp;lsquo;naturality&amp;rsquo; can manage to eat up so much of the Supreme Court’s time. The whole concept of civilization, of fundamental rights and of a legal system that you use to enforce these rights is quite against the fierce, blood-thirsty and no-holds-barred show that nature provides to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a common motif across several debates across the world which span a wide range of issues, from sexual activities to dietary preferences (sometimes, both at the same time). For instance, most people simply &amp;lsquo;inherit&amp;rsquo; their dietary restrictions ([non]vegetarianism), but the level of hypocrisy I often see in the whole affair is staggering. People who would eat hens, turkeys, goats, sheep, fish, lobsters and what not without any qualms might criticize someone for eating dogs or insects. Or, considering that the majority of non-vegetarians don&amp;rsquo;t mind animals being killed to be served on their plate, it is funny that the same people suddenly find bestiality &amp;lsquo;wrong&amp;rsquo;. I find bestiality disgusting too, but, as a non-vegetarian, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have any moral authority to consider it &amp;lsquo;wrong&amp;rsquo;, and worse, punishable, if someone indulges in sexual activity with a goat, when I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t bat an eyelid about the same goat being killed and placed on my plate to eat. What is it that makes it perfectly acceptable to brutally kill a goat but makes it wrong and illegal to put your dick in it (or its dick in you, or both—I have no frikking clue what people do with the goats they love, OK?) Whatever happens to the issue of &amp;lsquo;consent&amp;rsquo; when you put the goat’s throat under the cleaver?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these issues are not likely to be solved in the near future. And that&amp;rsquo;s because we refuse to THINK. The bottom line is that most of us haven&amp;rsquo;t given and will never give a lot of thought to why we do what we do before holding on dearly to things that we love to hold on dearly to. We inherit arbitrarily drawn lines and then defend them throughout our lives instead of stepping back and questioning them with any degree of logic or reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether the experimentation be on your plate or in your bedroom, the underlying problem is the same—we assume that just because something sounds or feels disgusting to us means that it should be stopped. This was probably a tenable position a century ago when lack of adequate transport and communication facilities meant that most people were born and raised in more or less geographically (and hence, ideologically) isolated areas and when it was difficult to imagine that there could exist large-scale differences in ideas and lifestyles. It would make sense in such a society to consider deviant behaviour as wrong and punishable. But it is surprising that we continue to be a largely intolerant society even when things such as the internet and other forms of mass-media, coupled with easy and relatively cheap international transport, have brought people and ideas closer than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is something we imbibe right from our childhood. Anyone who&amp;rsquo;s been through the school system has usually either been on the perpetrating or receiving end of cruel ridicule or bullying just because someone was slightly deviant from established social norms. The social bonding that having these norms provides and the greater social bonding that comes from having a common enemy seem to be strong enough to make heartless beasts out of even pre-teen children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not losing hope, though. The world does seem to be moving towards greater tolerance and understanding, and it is of course heartening to see that India is a part of this change too, even if a bit reluctantly. I don’t consider myself to be a champion of liberalism, but I just wish people (including me) sit back and &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; before trying to victimize people who’re minding their own business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(P.S. This post is not about the individual debates that I have mentioned, but about a general trend. I am bored to death of the Veg/NV debate, and this post isn&amp;rsquo;t about that, so please do not write comments about why one should or shouldn&amp;rsquo;t eat animals.)&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>How bad is sexy?</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/02/how-bad-is-sexy/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 29 Feb 2012 11:07:58 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/02/how-bad-is-sexy/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Mamta Sharma, the head of the National Commission for Women, India, has gotten herself into trouble by saying (at a function) that girls shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be offended if guys call them &lt;em&gt;sexy&lt;/em&gt;, as it&amp;rsquo;s a word with positive connotations of beauty and charm. Her exact quote (or at least what HT reported) was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boys pass comments on girls terming them sexy but sexy means beautiful and charming. We should not see it in negative sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, half the country, from the BJP&amp;rsquo;s state vice-president to various women organizations, pounced on Ms Sharma and was quick to criticize her statement. People said that they were &amp;lsquo;outraged&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;shocked&amp;rsquo; that a person who&amp;rsquo;s the head of a national body whose mandate is &amp;ldquo;protecting and promoting the interests of women&amp;rdquo; (text from their website) could say something so &amp;lsquo;unfortunate&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, those who know me know that I am very very liberal in my outlook and ideology. For instance, I find it 3 parts outrageous and 1 part hilarious that in the year 2012, we still have people giving arguments of _naturality_ to defend their bigotry in trying to criminalize sex among consenting adults, that too in the highest court of law in this country. And, I find it disappointing that most of the anger against the two ministers who were caught watching porn on their cellphones while the house was in session is for the porn part instead of the _watching during session_ part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the current issue is not about which bodily (or other) orifice you can insert your penis into legally or when you should look at videos of the same. It&amp;rsquo;s about the connotations of the word &amp;lsquo;sexy&amp;rsquo;. And as far as this issue goes, I don&amp;rsquo;t see myself siding with Ms Sharma. There are two relevant issues here—the meaning (and hence, connotations) of the word sexy, and the ramifications of its use. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the meaning goes, I think there&amp;rsquo;s really no case. Ms Sharma claims that the word is often used by youngsters to mean beautiful and charming. I think she also wished to imply that the word &lt;em&gt;sexy&lt;/em&gt; has proliferated youth-speak sufficiently for it to be non-offensive. Well, no, yes, and no. First off, young people do use this word often as a synonym for _cool_ or &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, but, so far as I can see, this is limited to non-living things. I may describe your car as sexy, and you will understand that I want to convey that I find it very cool or nice. But if I describe your sister as sexy, I am sure you won&amp;rsquo;t process it with the same degree of indifference. Also, just because something is used often doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it becomes less offensive. As I discussed in a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=387&#34; title=&#34;Suarez, Evra and Racial Insults&#34;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;, you have to look at the parties involved and the nature of the interaction before you declare something as (in)appropriate. Just because a guy can call his friend &amp;lsquo;behenchod&amp;rsquo; without any offence given or taken doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that this word becomes inoffensive for all scenarios and all people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the second issue—who&amp;rsquo;s using it for whom, and what happens when they do so. Which is where lies the crux of the whole issue, and which is were I feel Ms Sharma goes wrong. She has defended herself by saying that her comments were intended to be taken in a broad sense. How broad should our sense be? We are talking about issues relating to harassment of women in everyday life, whether it be at the workplace or in a public bus in Delhi. We are not talking about friendly conversation among, erm, friends. If a guy tells his girlfriend that she&amp;rsquo;s looking sexy, I am sure she will be flattered rather than insulted. If this adjective is used in a group of close friends, all of whom are comfortable in each other&amp;rsquo;s company, no one is likely to take offence. But such instances aren&amp;rsquo;t the ones NCW (or anyone) needs to worry about. What the NCW needs to worry about are cases of eve-teasing, cases of discrimination at the workplace, and cases where women are made to feel unnecessarily uncomfortable/insecure by the actions of men. And in all these cases, expecting a woman to not be uncomfortable with the word _sexy_ is not reasonable. In fact, the reality is far more problematic. Ms Sharma says that _sexy_ is the same as &lt;em&gt;beautiful&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;charming&lt;/em&gt;, but the truth is that the first instinct of a woman on being called _beautiful_ when she is walking down a dark alleyway in Noida would not be to blush, but to run as fast as her legs can carry her. If she is called sexy instead, I would also expect her to scream while she sprints for her life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this unfair to menfolk, many of whom are god-fearing, law-abiding citizens whose only desire is to sincerely compliment a lady? Probably yes. But this is a reputation that we have brought upon ourselves. As &lt;a href=&#34;http://kateharding.net/2009/10/08/guest-blogger-starling-schrodinger%E2%80%99s-rapist-or-a-guy%E2%80%99s-guide-to-approaching-strange-women-without-being-maced/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; that got viral explains, women see unknown men as &lt;em&gt;Schrödinger&amp;rsquo;s Rapists.&lt;/em&gt; Here&amp;rsquo;s the relevant part:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #993300;&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you approach me in public, you are Schrödinger’s Rapist. You may or may not be a man who would commit rape. I won’t know for sure unless you start sexually assaulting me. I can’t see inside your head, and I don’t know your intentions. If you expect me to trust you—to accept you at face value as a nice sort of guy—you are not only failing to respect my reasonable caution, you are being cavalier about my personal safety.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #000000;&#34;&gt;It boils down to undue attention. Your boss is not supposed to be basing his decisions on your perceived attractiveness, so the use of an adjective that refers to it explicitly is likely to make you uncomfortable. When you are constantly on your guard as you travel in the Mumbai local train at 11 p.m., you do not want people to make references to your beauty, or worse, sexuality. I am not saying that women&lt;em&gt; should &lt;/em&gt;be offended if someone calls them sexy. Saying that would be prescriptive and stupid. I am merely saying that it is not reasonable on Ms Sharma&amp;rsquo;s part to expect women in this country to take &lt;em&gt;sexy&lt;/em&gt; (in places where it is irrelevant) as a harmless compliment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is being blown out of proportion, though. While I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with what Ms Sharma said, I can see what she meant to say, which is probably that one should not fly off the handle merely on being complimented for one&amp;rsquo;s looks. India is one of those countries where the average woman is usually as offended for being called sexy as she would be for being called ugly. Go figure!&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>EYE-SEAT or E-SEAT?</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/02/eye-seat-or-e-seat/</link>
          <pubDate>Sat, 18 Feb 2012 15:03:42 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/02/eye-seat-or-e-seat/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color: #008000;&#34;&gt;[Edit: A few days after this post was written, the powers-that-be decided to retain the name JEE for the new entrance test that would replace JEE+AIEEE combo from next year]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JEE and AIEEE, two flagship examinations that used to be conducted for students aspiring to secure an admission into the IITs/NITs are going to be  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Goodbye-JEE--welcome-ISEET-from-2013/911645/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;replaced &lt;/a&gt;by an exam called ISEET (Indian Science Engineering Eligibility Test). There are of course loads of issues surrounding this decision that the government took, but none that come under the purview of Linguistrix. Except one thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would people pronounce ISEET? It&amp;rsquo;s of course a frivolous issue compared to more important questions concerning this matter, but relevant enough for Linguistrix. I remember a classmate who used to pronounce AIEEE as A-I-EEEEEEEEEEEE, as opposed to A-I-Triple E. And I&amp;rsquo;ve also heard a few people pronounce JEE as if it were one word (&lt;em&gt;gee&lt;/em&gt;). I see two candidate pronunciations for ISEET—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EYE-SEAT: This is personally my favourite. Given the &lt;em&gt;i&lt;/em&gt; in the beginning and the general proliferation of words such as iPad, iPod, iTouch, I am prepared to put a bit of money on this pronunciation catching on. Also, ISER is pronounced EYE-SUHR, IIFA is pronounced EYE-FAH, so this matches the pattern. &lt;span style=&#34;color: #0000ff;&#34;&gt;(Edit: Yashovardhan Siwach also added that this pronunciation also makes punny sense because all aspirants EYE-SEATs)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;E-SEAT: Someone suggested this one, but I don&amp;rsquo;t see it rolling. I could be wrong of course—I am but a humble blogger who&amp;rsquo;s entirely powerless against the Norma Loquendi.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? What would it be then? If, as my intuition says, the EYE-SEAT pronunciation catches on, I would be able to say with glee—&amp;rsquo;You read it first on Linguistrix!&amp;lsquo;. If, however, the E-SEAT one catches on (or something totally different), well, I did say I could be wrong&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The opposite of progress—deconstructing the pun</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/02/the-opposite-of-progressdeconstructing-the-pun/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2012 14:49:05 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/02/the-opposite-of-progressdeconstructing-the-pun/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A joke (sorta lame but, whatever) that has been going around on the internet since ages (&lt;em&gt;if pro is the opposite of con, what&amp;rsquo;s the opposite of progress?&lt;/em&gt;) was finally picked up and printed on the front page of Mumbai Mirror, in light of today&amp;rsquo;s civic body elections, thus ensuring that the handful of people who hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard it earlier are now aware of it. The grammatical mistake (&lt;strong&gt;IT&lt;/strong&gt; shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been there) and the bad spacing (you need a space after the comma) notwithstanding, a lot of people would find it decently funny, so I thought I would take this opportunity to write a bit about this pun, so to speak, from a linguistic angle, because, well, that&amp;rsquo;s what Linguistrix is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Untitled-1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-508&#34; title=&#34;Progress&#34; src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Untitled-1-300x274.jpg?fit=300%2C274&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; srcset=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Untitled-1.jpg?resize=300%2C274 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Untitled-1.jpg?w=540 540w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this post is NOT a rant, and I am NOT saying that whoever originally came up with this joke should have thought of what I will discuss now, or should have researched it out. No. I am just saying that, now that we have had our share of laughs over this joke (if at all), let&amp;rsquo;s spend a couple of minutes looking at how it stands linguistically. Morphologically and etymologically, to be more precise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.etymonline.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;EtymOnline&lt;/a&gt; gloss for the two words in question. First, &lt;em&gt;progress&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=progress&amp;allowed_in_frame=0&#34;&gt;progress (n.)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&#34;Look up progress at Dictionary.com&#34; href=&#34;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=progress&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;Look up progress at Dictionary.com&#34; src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.etymonline.com/graphics/dictionary.gif?resize=16%2C16&#34; alt=&#34;Look up progress at Dictionary.com&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;early 15c., &#34;a going on, action of walking forward,&#34; from O.Fr. progres, from L. progressus (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=progression&amp;allowed_in_frame=0&#34;&gt;progression&lt;/a&gt;). Figurative sense of &#34;growth, development, advancement to higher stages&#34; is from c.1600. The verb is attested from c.1590 in the lit. sense, c.1600 in the fig. sense.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at the supposed opposite, converting the &lt;em&gt;pro&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;con&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=congress&amp;allowed_in_frame=0&#34;&gt;congress&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&#34;Look up congress at Dictionary.com&#34; href=&#34;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=congress&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;Look up congress at Dictionary.com&#34; src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.etymonline.com/graphics/dictionary.gif?resize=16%2C16&#34; alt=&#34;Look up congress at Dictionary.com&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;c.1400, &#34;body of attendants; also &#34;meeting of armed forces&#34; (mid-15c.); main modern sense of &#34;coming together of people, a meeting&#34; is from 1520s; from L. congressus &#34;a friendly meeting; a hostile encounter,&#34; pp. of congredi &#34;meet with, fight with,&#34; from com- &#34;together&#34; (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=com-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0&#34;&gt;com-&lt;/a&gt;) + gradi &#34;to walk,&#34; from gradus &#34;a step&#34; (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=grade&amp;allowed_in_frame=0&#34;&gt;grade&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we look at the entry for &lt;em&gt;progression&lt;/em&gt;, we get closer to our goal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=progression&amp;allowed_in_frame=0&#34;&gt;progression&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&#34;Look up progression at Dictionary.com&#34; href=&#34;http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=progression&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;Look up progression at Dictionary.com&#34; src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.etymonline.com/graphics/dictionary.gif?resize=16%2C16&#34; alt=&#34;Look up progression at Dictionary.com&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;mid-15c., &#34;action of moving forward,&#34; from O.Fr. progression (early 15c.), from L. progressionem (nom. progressio) &#34;a going forward,&#34; from progressus, pp. of progredi &#34;go forward,&#34; from pro- &#34;forward&#34; (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pro-&amp;allowed_in_frame=0&#34;&gt;pro-&lt;/a&gt;) + gradi &#34;to step, walk,&#34; from gradus &#34;step&#34; (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=grade&amp;allowed_in_frame=0&#34;&gt;grade&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the _pro_ in &lt;em&gt;progress&lt;/em&gt; is indeed the &lt;em&gt;pro&lt;/em&gt; that means _forward/in favour of _and which is routinely used in the phrase &lt;em&gt;pros and cons&lt;/em&gt;. The _gress_ comes from the root &lt;em&gt;gradi&lt;/em&gt;, which we can also find in words such as &lt;em&gt;ingress, egress&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;regress&lt;/em&gt; (the first two are frequently used in phonetics when describing speech sounds—&lt;em&gt;pulmonary egressive&lt;/em&gt; sounds are those that are produced by air-stream originating from the lungs and moving out)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the _pro_ in progress sounds legit, and &lt;em&gt;con&lt;/em&gt; is indeed the opposite of &lt;em&gt;pro&lt;/em&gt;, does this lead us to the natural conclusion that the joke is indeed linguistically sound? It would, except for one snag. The _con_ in the word _congress_ is a different morpheme, which, though similar in form to the _con_ meaning _against_ (and which is short for &lt;em&gt;contra&lt;/em&gt;), has a completely different identity and meaning. This &lt;em&gt;con,&lt;/em&gt; which is allomorphic to _com,_ means &lt;em&gt;together&lt;/em&gt;, is what you see in words like &lt;em&gt;companion&lt;/em&gt; (com+pan~[eats] bread together) and _convenient_ (con+venire=comes together/comes along) and which is also present in the word &lt;em&gt;congress&lt;/em&gt;, meaning w&lt;em&gt;alking together&lt;/em&gt;.  The word &lt;em&gt;congress&lt;/em&gt; has loads of uses, and while the &lt;em&gt;being together&lt;/em&gt; meaning of the word might not be very apparent in the sense of a political party, it&amp;rsquo;s very clear in its other uses. If you&amp;rsquo;ve read the English translation of Kama Sutra, you&amp;rsquo;ll have noticed that the word _congress_  has been used umpteen times in place of what would nowadays be called &lt;em&gt;sexual intercourse&lt;/em&gt;, or just plain &lt;em&gt;sex&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we have then is a case of having two morphemes identical in spelling but with completely different functions. This is nothing uncommon, actually—the morpheme _s_ in English serves three roles—it&amp;rsquo;s the third person singular morpheme for verbs (&lt;em&gt;he play&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), it&amp;rsquo;s the plural morpheme (&lt;em&gt;these play&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) and it&amp;rsquo;s also the morpheme that makes possessive forms from the respective nouns (&lt;em&gt;this play&amp;rsquo;&lt;strong&gt;s&lt;/strong&gt; name&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So well, there we go. A joke that would have cleared the linguistic firewall if not for two morphemes hiding under the same orthographic representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same explanation applies to the joke that&amp;rsquo;s been going around along with this one (and that was apparently published as a &lt;em&gt;reply&lt;/em&gt;)—_if pro is the opposite of con, what&amp;rsquo;s the opposite of constitution?_ In fact, instead of acting as a rebuttal to the original joke/accusation, it actually supports it, by showing the &lt;em&gt;constitution&lt;/em&gt; (generally considered a good thing) as the opposite of &lt;em&gt;prostitution&lt;/em&gt; (generally considered a bad thing). It does show the ridiculousness of applying backyard morphology as and when you see fit. There&amp;rsquo;s no explanation as to why the hell one would examine the purported opposite of the word &lt;em&gt;constitution&lt;/em&gt;. The aim here is not to convert all _pros_ to _cons_ or the other way round, but to take a jab at a party whose name appears (superficially) to be the opposite of the word &lt;em&gt;progress&lt;/em&gt;. None of this is affecting people though, who seem to see an illogical reply to a misleading and grammatically incorrect jab as LEGIT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are Linguistrix readers. You consider both manifestos and morphology while deciding who to vote for. You are part of the 1%, but that&amp;rsquo;s not a bad thing in this case. Vote wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Back in November, I &lt;a title=&#34;Anil Kapoor चट्टानों MI4!&#34; href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=212&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt; what happened when Tom Cruise used machine translation to connect to his Indians fans. Since I am in Japan, I come across bad English translations on a daily basis. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t posted any on Linguistrix because Chinglish/Janglish is very common stuff and you get them dime by the dozen. But today I found this one that is incomprehensible in at least two languages (I have to check up my Chinese friend to find out whether it makes any more sense in Chinese than it does in English/Hindi. &lt;span style=&#34;color: #333399;&#34;&gt;Edit: It is bad too&lt;/span&gt;). This was put up outside the cafeteria in NIMS. It is also interesting that whoever put up the notice thought of putting a Hindi translation too. There are very few Indian employees in NIMS, and the ones that are there would know English well (though it&amp;rsquo;s a different matter that even the English one makes little sense).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-499&#34; title=&#34;notice&#34; src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/notice-300x225.jpg?fit=300%2C225&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; srcset=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/notice.jpg?resize=300%2C225 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/notice.jpg?w=512 512w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Japanese version is basically informing readers that their (lunch) Prepaid Cards have been cancelled until the end of March. The machine translated English and Hindi are of course mangled beyond recognition. The last part कृपया समझो! could as well have been a plea to the reader to figure out what has been written. It is funny for two reasons—notices such as these are usually written with the _aap_ verb forms (कृपया समझिए), and even if they aren&amp;rsquo;t, it is very rare to see the _tum_ form of the verb with &lt;em&gt;kripaya&lt;/em&gt;. You will find notices with the _tum_ form of the verb, such as &amp;lsquo;कंडोम का इस्तेमाल करो!&amp;rsquo;, but it is a rare sign (if at all) that would use this verb form with &lt;em&gt;kripaya.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been online on FB/Twitter today, you must have noticed that the Indian part of the inter-web has gone crazy over a supposed screenshot from a Star News telecast. I say &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; because my Facebook feed has been flooded with all kinds of stupidity in the last few days—from images of Gods &lt;a href=&#34;http://a6.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/409531_365381240139818_100000038347737_1438486_2132740108_n.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;magically&lt;/a&gt; appearing on the top of mountains to &lt;a href=&#34;http://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/423548_173071509469429_135053696604544_253808_56745101_n.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that Louis Braille was an Italian king—so naturally I have developed a deep distrust of all society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/398397_217479301682550_153904844706663_423147_1411481133_n.jpg?resize=422%2C319&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the first such instance. The media seems to have a thing for Dhoni and what goes on down under.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/4.bp.blogspot.com/_omuQRYZ6gkI/SjivObvkPeI/AAAAAAAABOQ/rH0eDfIDECk/s400/dhoni_indiatv_bat_twelve_12_inch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the second one&amp;rsquo;s from India TV, so they might have deliberately put it that way for all you know. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know Hindi, the second one translates to &amp;lsquo;Dhoni&amp;rsquo;s 12-incher will get us the World Cup!&amp;rsquo; while the text on the first image says &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;Sabse Keemati Chhakka&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;, which translates to &amp;lsquo;Most expensive &lt;em&gt;chhakka&amp;rsquo;. Chhakka&lt;/em&gt; refers to the term for &amp;lsquo;6 runs&amp;rsquo; in cricket (for those who don&amp;rsquo;t know about cricket, don&amp;rsquo;t bother wrapping your mind around it). But &lt;em&gt;Chhakka &lt;/em&gt;(also, &lt;em&gt;Hijra&lt;/em&gt;) in Hindi also refers to (and I borrow Wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s definition here) physiological males who have feminine gender identity, women&amp;rsquo;s clothing and other feminine gender roles and usually live in well-defined, organized, all-hijra communities. In short, it&amp;rsquo;s the kind of thing that makes an Indian family disown its child and leave it to live its messed up life the way it sees fit. The social ramifications of being a c_hakka_ in South Asia are soul-crushingly cruel, but since this is Linguistrix, and not SadThingsAboutIndiaTrix, I would refrain from talking about them in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the bisemy of the word &lt;em&gt;Chhakka&lt;/em&gt;, and the puns that result out of it, are hardly new fare. Any person who&amp;rsquo;s lived his way through school in North India would have been either on the receiving end or the perpetrating end of such wordplay at least once in his life. This of course does not mean that they are aware of what &lt;em&gt;chhakkas&lt;/em&gt; really are—for most, it&amp;rsquo;s a species that is supposed to be made fun of and the only kind of beggars their parents always give some money to. But, I digress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I wrote this post was to look at what it is that causes such puns, i.e. when does the interpretation veer enough towards the unintended one to make it funny. Language Log has a category of posts called Crash Blossoms  (a kind of Garden Path sentence where your mind keeps going onto multiple interpretations due to the polysemy of the words involved). An example would be the headline &lt;em&gt;Doctor Suspected in Town House Collapse Dies.&lt;/em&gt; It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take much to spot such difficult to parse headlines and correct them, yet they routinely get overlooked by the subeditors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;__I am interested in how much a particular usage needs to be polarized towards one meaning for that meaning to be activated in the listener/reader&amp;rsquo;s mind. For instance, many other usages of the word _chhakka_ in the context of cricket can also be interpreted in the &lt;em&gt;Hijra&lt;/em&gt; sense very conveniently, but they aren&amp;rsquo;t. This is an actual line from a report I took from a news website—उस एक छक्के ने वर्ल्डकप फाइनल की यादें ताजा कर दी। In fact, now that I think of it, I am not sure whether the first picture was funny when it was actually being shown, or is it only funny now when we look at it in isolation. Would adding a few words around it dilute the one-sidedness of the meaning? Even in isolation? Questions, questions, questions.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;div id=&#34;:2hw&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
      Back when we were in Canada, Ramu and I used to love ginger biscuits, whereas Sangram and Goel hated them, giving us the opportunity to finally use &lt;em&gt;&#39;Bandar kya jaane adrak ka swaad&#39;&lt;/em&gt; (Wiki: Someone without refined tastes cannot appreciate a fine thing) literally. In general, however, I would rather not want to experience famous idioms and proverbs literally (&lt;em&gt;sar mundaate hi ole pade &lt;/em&gt;[Facing the repercussions of an action right after you take it] would be particularly painful, especially since I once got caught in a terrible hailstorm in Stuttgart&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;But today morning, it almost happened. I boiled pasta to make lunch, and when it was done, needed to throw the excess water away. The kitchen sink here has a waste grinder-cum-disposer attached to it, so you are advised to not throw boiling water in it lest it damage the rubber cover. So I took the pot to the bath tub and started draining it. As soon as it started falling into the tub, the steam that rose fogged my spectacles, so, apart from the noise of falling water, I had no sensory clue as to what was happening. All this while, I was also mentally chuckling about emptying pasta water into a bath-tub, and thinking about how the hot water would hopefully &#39;sterilize&#39; the tub. Well, it was a bad time to be geeky—what with my clouded specs, and my mind on dying microorganisms, I forgot that there was pasta in the pot, and happily upturned it, thinking about the boiling hot deluge I had subjected all the assorted microscopic flora and fauna to, visualizing those antiseptic soap advertisements where the soap kills all but 2 trembling microbes. It was after 5 seconds when the steam went away that I saw my lovely farfalle strewn all along the tub, and realized with horror what happened.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;p dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;
      It was too late, however. A lunch&#39;s worth of pasta and 20 minutes of cooking time and heating costs, all down the drain, quite literally. I cussed to no one in particular, stamped my feet, gave myself a mental FML, and moved on, the only saving grace being that I had experienced a less dangerous version of throwing the baby out with the bath water. But it got dangerously close. A bathtub was indeed involved.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

          <title>Where’s the coffee in my strawberry latte?</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/02/wheres-the-coffee-in-my-strawberry-latte/</link>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;After 3 years of traveling alone and spending 2 years telling others how to do it, I did something as stupid as forgetting my bag in the bottom luggage hold of the bus after I got down at Kyoto station on the freezing cold morning of 27th January, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, I realized this within less than 2 minutes of getting down, and thus began a series of frenzied calls to a &amp;lsquo;Japanese Only&amp;rsquo; emergency number. If I could talk in English with them, I would probably have shouted something like _Stop the fucking bus!_ (which is of course optimistic to the point of ridiculousness—a Japanese driver would donate his only kidney more readily than delay public transport). But my Japanese is only good enough to convey what I want to convey in a gentle, civil fashion, so I did just that. I calmed down, and explained to him what had happened. Finally, I did get my luggage back, due in part to Japan&amp;rsquo;s efficient and speedy goods delivery services, not to mention the inherent niceness of the people here. And there goes another &amp;lsquo;experience&amp;rsquo; in the pool, and next time I tell juniors not to forget their luggage, I will have a first-hand story to narrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what had this got to do with linguistics? Nothing, really, but I was feeling a bit ashamed of myself, and thought that a visit to the Linguistrix confession box would help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what happened later that day _does_ have to do with linguistics. Just before catching the train from Nara to Kyoto, I headed into a convenience store and, among other things, grabbed this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2586.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-480&#34; title=&#34;IMG_2586&#34; src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2586-225x300.jpg?fit=225%2C300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; srcset=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2586.jpg?resize=225%2C300 225w, https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IMG_2586.jpg?w=612 612w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To tell you the truth, I was driven more by curiosity than anything else. In the few tens of milliseconds it took me to read the label and process it, I wondered what coffee flavored with strawberries would taste like. I like both coffee and strawberries, but I had this lingering suspicion that mixing them wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be that great an idea. What better way to judge this than try it out, I thought, as I grabbed it and proceeded to the checkout queue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But as I stood on the escalator on the way to the platform and looked at the image on the tetra-pack, I began to think about what it was that I had purchased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this is a rather interesting issue. _Latte__ _is an Italian word and literally just means _milk_ (and is cognate words such as lactation). The full name for a coffee with milk, i.e. espresso with milk, is Café Latte or Caffè latte (&lt;em&gt;café au lait&lt;/em&gt; in French)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;em&gt;latte&lt;/em&gt; is an Italian word, and as far as English is concerned, it’s been lexicalized to mean &lt;em&gt;coffee with milk&lt;/em&gt;, not just milk. A &lt;em&gt;Hazelnut Latte&lt;/em&gt; generally means a Latte with hazelnut syrup (and a 30% rise in price), not milk with hazelnut syrup. A _skim latte_ is not skim milk, but latte made from skim milk. Likewise, a cinnamon latte, is not cinnamon flavored milk (tasty though it would be), but a milk coffee with cinnamon added to it. But is this terminology only specific to the coffee industry, or is it now universal in the English speaking world? I would go with the latter. I have never seen &lt;em&gt;latte&lt;/em&gt; being used in English to refer to milk alone, and If you go to a McDonalds and say that you want a latte along with whatever variety of deep fried meat and starch you’ve ordered, you will be given a coffee, not a tetra-pack of milk (though a lot of McDs do offer milk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what would a Strawberry Latte be? A latte flavoured with strawberries (à la hazelnut latte), or strawberry milk? As far as usage of the word &lt;em&gt;latte&lt;/em&gt; in English goes, I think there is no doubt that it should be the first option. In fact, Starbucks actually has a drink of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.starbucksfs.com/Recipes/Espresso/Strawberry_Flavored_Latte&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this name&lt;/a&gt;, which it describes as &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our classic rich, full-bodied Starbucks® espresso in steamed milk lightly topped with foam and complemented by your customers&amp;rsquo; favorite Fontana® flavors.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;, where Fontana is apparently a brand of strawberry syrup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strawberry Latte I bought was, as you’d have guessed, just strawberry flavored milk.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Stupid analogies are like stupid analogies</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/01/stupid-analogies-are-like-stupid-analogies/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2012 17:26:40 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2012/01/stupid-analogies-are-like-stupid-analogies/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have always had a love-hate relation with analogies, though it has mostly veered towards hate. I agree that they can occasionally be illuminating and can make difficult concepts more palatable, but I have often considered them evil and felt that they do more harm than good. Usually, they over-simplify a concept to &amp;ldquo;dumb it down&amp;rdquo;, so to speak, but end up creating easy-to-kill straw-men, or make arguments go into a tangent just because people start arguing over the analogy instead of the original premise. Also, I feel they sometimes fail to achieve their purpose—which was providing a meaningful insight into the issue at hand. If I understand a concept well, I would be able to appreciate the analogies that can be drawn from it. I would also have the necessary insight to understand places where the analogy would fail. However, all this is fairly opaque to the person at whom that analogy was aimed, so it often defeats the purpose. This is especially so because it is extremely rare that an analogy maps with the original bijectively. Usually, an analogy connects only a few aspects of both situations, and that too in a fairly tenuous fashion. And if your listeners try to over-explore an analogy, it just ends up backfiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am particularly wary of analogies that are part of school teaching. Plenty of the Sanskrit shlokas and Hindi dohe rely on analogies to bring home the point, but the way they are taught, the analogies are used for justification rather than exposition, which is just plain wrong. Of course, I realize the value of these pithy sayings/couplets/expressions/etc. so I am not objecting to them—all I am saying is that I prefer to keep analogies at arm&amp;rsquo;s length in discussions and arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A particularly delicious abuse of analogies is the whole animal analogy business—a treacherous (and highly convenient) ground to base your argument on. It works both ways, so you can use it irrespective of which side of the argument you are on. There&amp;rsquo;s always an animal analogy out there. Sample this—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Premise: Humans are like animals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Argument: Dogs don&amp;rsquo;t discriminate on the basis of breed! Why should we discriminate on the basis of caste?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never mind the fact that no one would even question this bullshit. What do you know about whether dogs discriminate on the basis of _breed_ or not? I don&amp;rsquo;t know much about dogs, but I suspect that an Alsatian won&amp;rsquo;t usually have sex with a Pomeranian (unless, of course, it&amp;rsquo;s getting bored or something). Should that be considered as animal casteism? Should humans refuse to procreate with people from other races because dogs apparently do the same? It&amp;rsquo;s just pile upon pile of stupidity made to look profound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Premise: Humans are not like animals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;em&gt;Argument: Dogs have no problem having sex in the open. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean humans should start doing the same!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dude, settle it once and for all whether or not humans should look at dogs as models for emulation.  Note that you can&amp;rsquo;t resort to circular arguments claiming that &amp;lsquo;_discrimination is bad, hence humans shouldn&amp;rsquo;t definitely do it if even animals aren&amp;rsquo;t doing it_ &amp;rsquo;.  &amp;rsquo;Discrimination is wrong&amp;rsquo; was supposed to be the conclusion, not the explanation. If your audience could have understood that at face value, you won&amp;rsquo;t have needed a stupid animal analogy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could use the humans-are-like-animals argument to say that it is OK for men to kill weaker men while looking for a suitable mate, and I could use the humans-are-not-like-animals to claim that it is OK for men to kill for pleasure. Both are stupid arguments, but the animal analogy didn&amp;rsquo;t shed any light on them. In fact, it made them worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I hate them in serious discussions—they are argument-crutches. What sounds like a cool analogy is often just a way to cover up shitty arguments and get rid of the burden of serious proof.  Deep-seated issues such as those of ethics, morals, &amp;lsquo;freedom&amp;rsquo; etc. cannot be solved by animal analogies, and heck, can&amp;rsquo;t even be understood using animal analogies. You need to face the problem in its entirety, and you have to face it on its home ground. It&amp;rsquo;s tough, yes, but it&amp;rsquo;s the only real solution. Otherwise you have idiots who will claim that contraception is bad because it is unnatural (!) and that gay marriage is wrong because it is unnatural. How about I claim that polygamy, adultery and cannibalism are OK because all three are found among animals? Animals have been known to have sex forcibly. Does that mean rape is natural? These analogy-toting idiots don&amp;rsquo;t spend even one minute on any actual justification. They get away with bullshitting about nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways, this worse than bullshit, which I use here to mean &lt;em&gt;content-less blather that is so convoluted that its truth value is difficult to evaluate, and which was never even intended to convey a particular truth value&lt;/em&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s because while BS makes you look like an idiot, analogies make you look smart and witty and profound, thus ridding you of the burden of proof and giving your audience a false sense of awe and understanding. It helps you get an upper hand in an argument without actually making a great deal of sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often hear arguments which treat human languages and programming languages as practically the same thing, and freely try to justify and rationalize their opinions and assertions regarding human languages by giving analogies with computer languages. Leaving aside the sheer audacity of someone comparing something as deep, complex and intensely fascinating as human language with something that pales several orders of magnitude in front of it (I speak from a pretty objective viewpoint), the simple fact is that such an analogy is highly untenable, and is almost always likely to derail the argument.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Evacuating in an orderly fashion</title>

          <pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2012 17:20:25 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night, at about 2 a.m., I was jolted out of my sleep by a harsh sound. There seemed to be a lot of noise all around but I was too groggy to make sense of what was going on. When I came back to my senses a few seconds later, I began making sense of the noise—&amp;rsquo;FIRE! FIRE! THERE IS A FIRE ON THE FOURTH FLOOR! PLEASE EVACUATE IN AN ORDERLY FASHION&amp;rsquo;, followed by something similar in Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I went out and got down the stairs, along with around 40–50 other residents of this complex. Luckily, there was no fire, and the alarm appeared to have been triggered by mistake. But as I stood waiting in the reception area, I began to think of the announcement that has brought me there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The place I am staying has been made for international visitors, so it is almost completely bilingual (Japanese and English), whether it be the buttons on the toilet-seat that warms itself invitingly when you sit on it, or emergency evacuation instructions that (thankfully) pull you out of your sleep. Even the Japanese here is largely foreigner-friendly. Messages in Japanese also have &lt;em&gt;Furigana,&lt;/em&gt; which means that the pronunciation of the Kanji characters is written on top—very helpful for people like me and countless other foreigners. Given all this, I expected that the emergency evacuation message would be more easily worded. I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to nitpick here—the importance of having very simple emergency messages struck me specially because, despite having basic knowledge of Japanese, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense of the Japanese announcement except for the part which said that there was a fire (KAJI DESU! KAJI DESU!). Arguably, that should be enough to convince you to get out, but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; understanding an important announcement can often cause more panic and fear, even if the part that isn&amp;rsquo;t understood is relatively irrelevant. &amp;lsquo;Evacuate&amp;rsquo; could be changed to &amp;lsquo;leave building&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;exit&amp;rsquo;, for instance. _Orderly _might be a bit difficult to understand too (though not that much), and&lt;em&gt; fashion&lt;/em&gt;, in the sense of _manner, _might not be well-known. _Order _does occur in the Basic English WordList, while the other two don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Vegetarian’s Kolaveri</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/12/vegetarians-kolaveri/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2011 11:31:17 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/12/vegetarians-kolaveri/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Enough. You have troubled us enough. Yes, you. Don’t run away. I am talking about you only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everytime you are going for dinner with us, you will be nuisance whole time. First you will make sarcastic comments—&amp;rdquo;Why are you looking in menu card? anyhow you will eat only paneer&amp;rdquo;. Then you will pounce on our food also. When waiter comes with non-veg food, you will give silly smiles and ask him to serve to you only but when he comes with veg food you will tell him to serve to everyone. Arey baba if you like your non-veg so much eat only non-veg or order more veg na, and quietly. Why should we be hungry because of you? After all your praise for non-veg, you are coming and munching on our Paneer Tikka. Why? And ultimately your food is eating our food only to survive. Now tell me who is superior?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any discussion on food means you will poke your nose and try to show that we have very less variety. Arey but half of you are just ordering butter chicken every single time you go to restaurant. Then what variety are you tasting you tell me. We will say XYZ restaurant is nice, but you will interrupt and say “No no. Their Fish Kolaveri was very bland”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You eat non-veg means you are automatically connoisseur kya? In front of veg people, you will make big boss comments like “the smoked flavour is good but it should have been marinaded with pineapple instead of papaya” or “The duck flambé is very delicate but it would have gone better with some white wine” or some other nonsense. As if we veg people are eating grass only. Man, you are eating food or selecting bride for yourself? For that you will ask mom-dad only, I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beech beech mein will you come and show this study and that study and tell us that humans have canine teeth in mouth to bite meat and all that, and make some comparisons with dogs. Uff ho. We also have lots of studies too but we keep quiet. Dogs are also good in that respect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what is this egg argument? Arey baba, go read Wikipedia. The hen which is giving the eggs we eat is not having husband only. She is laying them just like that without doing duties of wife. The eggs are not becoming hens even if we are not eating them. Now what’s your problem?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some veg guy makes some nice dish at home. First thing you are saying—&amp;rdquo;Man how can lasagna be veg!&amp;ldquo;. Bhai foreigners make dish means they add some meat always. They are like that only. Arey baba that guy is coming from brahmin family and there is appa and thatha in his house too. How he can make chicken in front of them? Should I go and tell your amma you are going to Sunny bar every weekend to get drunk? No na. Now who’s a scaredy cat? Tell me! But now you are quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will waste time boasting how you ate this and that and octopus and squid and what all horrible looking things with 4 heads and 20 feet, god only knows. Sometimes you put moving thing also in your mouth. Thooo. For the final time we are telling you baba we are not interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We manage our food properly. If we go to foreign country means we carry one 23 kg bag with theplas and phephlas and khakhras and murukkus and everything and do sightseeing while eating food. But you will annoy the guide by asking him direction for steakhouse and spend 2 hours there. arey baba that is your wish only but if you are spending 2 lakh rupees to go to New York, should you spend 2 hours in watching statue of liberty or eating steak at the 43rd on 5th?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is not that you don’t eat veg food at all. Mommy’s curd-rice you go and lick nicely. But in front of veg guys only you have to act oversmart. If some guy has saved money to eat in Subway on veg special day and is asking you to come along, you will give him a horrible look and reply like a lord—“huh. I don’t waste money on veg food”. All the delicious vegetables and sauces you are ignoring for some 50 grams of Tuna fish. Go to hell. Now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We follow religion blindly, you will accuse us. Fine. But at least YOU toh are non-veg na. You should eat everything and at all times right? Then why you are not eating cow? And why you are not eating non-veg on festival days? Suddenly you remember your culture haan? Chicken you are eating without problem. But will you eat pigeon crow rabbit? What about zebra or buffalo? Why this discrimination you tell me first. I have only one point ki boss if you are so enthu about non-veg you should eat any non-veg. I will put you with Chinese people. When they will show you their non-veg, you will do number 1 and 2 out of fear. I know very well that some of you will say ki you have no problem in eating frog kidney also. Disgusting man. Just leave this place. Go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final I am saying only this ki boss, you were born in non-veg family, we were born in veg family. You didn’t choose to become non-veg. We didn’t choose to be veg. Let’s just both keep quiet and eat in peace na. What’s the problem yaar!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always wondered what it is that makes the writing style in &lt;a href=&#34;http://localparty.tumblr.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LocalTeaParty&lt;/a&gt; hilarious. It feels like a caricature of Indian English, of course, but there are a lot of tiny cultural elements which add to the mix. And I guess there&amp;rsquo;s the added fact that you know it&amp;rsquo;s all intentional. A bit like the way the character Hansa used to talk in the TV series Khichdi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess the reason it resonates so well with most Indians who read it is because, at some level, that&amp;rsquo;s the most natural way we would want to express ourselves. And speaking idiomatic English might, for some people, be a bit like being straitjacketed, just the way speaking Mandarin is due to the tones. For instance, the particle &lt;em&gt;hi&lt;/em&gt;, which is very commonly used in Hindi as an intensifer, does translate to _only_ in English, but in many instances where you&amp;rsquo;d use _hi_ in Hindi, it would be unidiomatic to use _only_ in English. For instance—मैं कल &lt;strong&gt;ही&lt;/strong&gt; वहाँ गया था would be translated by many people as &lt;em&gt;I went there yesterday &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which is rather unidiomatic (I am actually tempted to classify it as ungrammatical, but I will need to check). This particle has counterparts in a lot of Indian languages. In Marathi, it is च [ts]—मी काल&lt;strong&gt;च&lt;/strong&gt; तिकडे गेलो होतो, in Gujarati it is જ [dʒ], and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use of the complementizer _ki_ instead of the English _that_ is another example. Also I feel expressions like &amp;ldquo;arrey bhai&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;baba&amp;rdquo; resonate more  than &amp;ldquo;dude&amp;rdquo; ever would. Although I am very fluent in English and never really translate from Hindi when talking in English, this kind of writing does feel close to heart. It seems your native language runs too deep within you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess that&amp;rsquo;s how a lot of us think too. LTP went ahead and put it in writing. If any non-Indian is reading this, I would love to know your comments on whether you find stuff written in this fashion funny, annoying or just plain boring. Please mail me at the domain &lt;em&gt;linguistrix.com&lt;/em&gt;, user-name &lt;em&gt;antariksh. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Footnote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eat non-vegetarian food myself, and I agree that both sides have very valid scientific, pragmatic and ethical arguments in their favour. I doubt if the impasse will ever be resolved, but the more I read about it, the more I am convinced of the pointlessness of picking up just one argument and having shallow debates about this. The only thing I seriously mean in the first part of this post is the last paragraph. Peace.&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/12/my-name-is-khan.-kh.-kh.-kh.-not-from-the-epiglottis./</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This post should have come 1½ years ago, but Linguistrix wasn’t extant back then, and I only remembered this yesterday as a friend professed his love for Shahrukh Khan. And this needs to be on Linguistrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You all know the routine.  The one time linguistics is mentioned in mainstream cinema, and it’s just plain wrong. If you’ve seen the movie, you’d know that the character Shahrukh plays makes a big deal about the fact that his name isn’t pronounced correctly, specifically the first sound. It’s KHAN, KH, KH, KH, from the epiglottis, you morons, he says, more than once in the movie—without the moron bit of course, though I won’t put it past him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s have the facts first. Don’t be scared by the terminology; I’ve explained it in detail. The &lt;em&gt;kh&lt;/em&gt; sound in the word Khan (Urdu: خان Hindi: ख़ान) is what is described as an &lt;em&gt;unvoiced&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;velar&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;fricative&lt;/em&gt;. The IPA symbol for this sound is [x].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unvoiced means that the vocal chords don’t vibrate while producing this sound. Velar implies that the region of production is the velum or the soft palate, shown in the diagram below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Velum&#34; src=&#34;https://i0.wp.com/upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Tonsils_diagram.jpg/250px-Tonsils_diagram.jpg?resize=250%2C207&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;em&gt;fricative&lt;/em&gt; means that this sound is produced by constricting the flow of air through a narrow channel, causing turbulence—in this case, the narrow channel is that formed by the back of the tongue and the velum. Other sounds pronounced at the velum are [k] and [g], two common sounds found in many languages of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fricatives are very common in English (s as in sit, z as zebra, ʃ as in shut and ʒ as in pleasure, f as in fat, v as in very, h as in hat, θ as in nothing, ð as in father are all fricatives), but not so in Hindi, where we have only three fricatives sounds (ʃ-श/ष, s-स, h-ह).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this sound is part of Urdu phonology but not really part of native Hindi phonology (except probably in areas where Urdu is also prevalent, such as Lucknow), most Hindi speakers don’t pronounce it, saying the aspirated velar stop [kʰ] instead, written in Hindi as ख. Singers and actors who are trained to pronounce Urdu words correctly do pronounce it (listen to Amitabh Bachchan, for instance).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this information is available on Wikipedia, of course, and it couldn’t have taken more than 15 minutes (including booting and shutting down time) to find it. The guys over at MNIK did a lot of research into Asperger’s so that Shahrukh could do the role realistically. Some linguistics would have helped too. It would be better still if language teaching in schools involved some teaching of phonetics instead of just making students memorize wrong definitions of nouns and verbs, and convert compound sentences to complex sentences or simple sentences, or similar pointless calisthenics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, don’t say I am ranting just like that. Since he repeats it so often in the film, this bit of linguistics general knowledge now has become mainstream, and people have now begun to use it in everyday life. Here’s what a blog says about some song:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the song is good but the way they say aankhen or aankhon se sounds bad as they say it like ‘Khan,’ from the epiglottis, which is not the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, though, I wish Bollywood didn&amp;rsquo;t try to make &lt;em&gt;fundae&lt;/em&gt; movies. I mean, we&amp;rsquo;ve obviously had good ones like Black and Taare Zameen Par, but, in general, when these guys try to make movies about &lt;em&gt;issues&lt;/em&gt;, I twitch. Look at Three Idiots, a hopelessly unrealistic picturization of a supposedly real problem. Or Dostana, which makes homosexuality look like a joke that poor, tharki men come up with to get cheap accommodation.[1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entertain us, don&amp;rsquo;t teach us. We have Wikipedia for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. Watch &lt;a href=&#34;http://antarikshbothale.wordpress.com/2011/06/25/shaitan/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shaitaan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] I know Three Idiots did some good. And I know Dostana did help make a taboo issue become talk-able, but I wonder why it always has to be done in such a clumsy way&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Seven Maids with Seven Mops—India and Internet Censorship</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/12/seven-maids-with-seven-mopsindia-and-internet-censorship/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2011 07:10:36 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/12/seven-maids-with-seven-mopsindia-and-internet-censorship/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Kapil Sibbal wants Facebook etc. to continuously monitor content so that anything that insults any one in the ruling party is nipped in the bud. And now, an Indian court has ordered FB and other social networking websites to  remove offensive content by Feb 6. The plaintiff has submitted a CD full of objectionable content found on online media, and wants it removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language and censorship go hand in hand. When you have people who want to say stuff, you have people who don&amp;rsquo;t want it being said. Drawing the line is often not easy, but it is important to acknowledge that a line is necessary. A smart line, which allows for free expression of opinions, which allows people to show dissent and which leads to an atmosphere of healthy debate, but which doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow inflammatory content that specifically incites violence against specific communities and groups, whether they be based on caste, religion, political affiliation, sexual orientation, or favourite brand of mineral water. Expressing dislike towards the way a particular group works should be allowed, but putting up inflammatory stuff that specifically attempts to incite violence should not be allowed. For instance, I can write blogs about my hatred for the use of Comic Sans MS and the abuse of Papyrus, but I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to do anything _bad_ to the people who do use/abuse these fonts,  except maybe send them a _Get Well Soon_ card. Of course it would be better if all this came with an increased tolerance for people who are different from us, but that&amp;rsquo;s too difficult. Picking on people who are different is an important way of social bonding, and we learn it pretty early in our life—whether it be jocks bullying geeks, or you making fun of the guy with curly hair or short fingers, or making some kid&amp;rsquo;s school life miserable because he is slightly effeminate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly get what the court wants this time. From whatever I could get from the news reports, the evidence submitted by the plaintiff was regarding anti-religious content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contents are certainly disrespectful to the religious sentiments and faith and seem to be intended to outrage the feelings of religious people whether Hindu, Muslim or Christian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certain degrading and obscene photographs of various political leaders belonging to different political parties and photographs pasted and the language used is also obscene, filthy and degrading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yes, I would want these things removed too, though I would want to know exactly what it is that the court considers as inflammatory, especially because the _outrage threshold_ for most people when it comes to religious issues is very low. And I obviously don&amp;rsquo;t want trigger happy groups to get what they want just because they don&amp;rsquo;t like something on the internet. But then the court further says—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears from a bare perusal of the documents that prima facie the accused in connivance with each other and other unknown persons are selling, publicly exhibiting and have put into circulation obscene, lascivious content which also appears to the prurient interests and tends to deprave and corrupt the persons who are likely to read, see or hear the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second half of that has been taken straight out of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/informationtechnologyact/s67.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Section 67&lt;/a&gt; of the Information Technology Act, apparently&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever publishes or transmits or causes to be published in the electronic form, any material which is lascivious or appeal to the prurient interest or if its effect is such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me translate the court&amp;rsquo;s statement from Legalese into English&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks as if FB and other sites, along with other people, are selling, publicly exhibiting and have put into circulation obscene, lascivious content which appears lecherous and tends to deprave and corrupt the persons who are likely to read, see or hear the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a lawyer, and I know watching 101 episodes of Boston Legal doesn&amp;rsquo;t count as getting a training in law, so I won&amp;rsquo;t talk about the legal aspects of the whole thing. But obscene content that _appears to the prurient interests_ (basically, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tharki&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tharki &lt;/a&gt;tendencies) can be anything—from models in bikinis (Y U EXPOSE THIGHS IN INDIA?) to an actual work of art such as Savita Bhabhi. Of course, I am not condoning any attempt made to tarnish someone&amp;rsquo;s image—if you are publishing morphed images of your co-worker just to get back at them for spurning your hopeless advances, you should be put behind the bars, sure. From what I understand, courts of law work based on a precedent. And I am uncomfortable about what precedent this ruling is likely to set. Won&amp;rsquo;t the pictures on a page about female anatomy be considered as obscene because the pics there might appeal to the prurient interests and deprave individuals deprived of a means of sexual release?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how can you even think of giving the social network responsibility and liability of policing content? What do you want exactly, local big brothers that decide what goes in and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t? I am not outraged. I am merely curious. And I am scared. This gives me terrible vibes. If you are a law student or lawyer, please give your views in the comments section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to make of it. In the long run, of course, I would want a change in these silly laws. In the short run, however, these two stanzas from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jabberwocky.com/carroll/walrus.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Walrus and the Carpenter&lt;/a&gt; by Lewis Carroll sound very relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Walrus and the Carpenter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Were walking close at hand;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They wept like anything to see&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such quantities of sand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If this were only cleared away,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They said, &amp;ldquo;it would be grand!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If seven maids with seven mops&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swept it for half a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you suppose,&amp;rdquo; the Walrus said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That they could get it clear?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I doubt it,&amp;rdquo; said the Carpenter,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And shed a bitter tear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure how FB plans to police its online content. It can certainly delete the specific pages which have been exhibited by the plaintiff, but the way this stuff respawns itself, Facebook is going to have to go on cleaning vast quantities of sand.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Suarez, Evra and Racial Insults</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/12/suarez-evra-and-racial-insults/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2011 06:00:38 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/12/suarez-evra-and-racial-insults/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;In what&amp;rsquo;s minty fresh news, Liverpool striker Suarez was given an 8-match ban for racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra. You may read about it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2076452/Luis-Suarez-given-match-ban-race-row.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Santosh Ananthakrishnan sent me the link to a discussion about the same on WebDiplomacy Forums.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a football n00b, and reading news reports about this incident has been an ordeal due to a bevy of unfamiliar names and abbreviations, but from what I have understood so far, the defence is that whatever Suarez called Evra is actually a playful and casual term where Suarez comes from. I don&amp;rsquo;t see how it being slightly less offensive in Spanish exculpates someone for using it with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I am not saying that any sequence of sounds in my language that sounds offensive in some other language should be held against me. For instance, the French term &lt;em&gt;salle à manger&lt;/em&gt;, meaning &lt;em&gt;dining hall&lt;/em&gt;, sounds roughly like saala-mon-jay, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean Hindi speakers should get offended on listening to it just because *saala* in Hindi happens to be offensive. And when a Chinese guy talks about the famous Mid Autumn Festival (中秋節, or Zhōngqiū jié), which sounds to Hindi ears as &lt;em&gt;chong-choo-tiye&lt;/em&gt;, you should certainly not pull him up for rudeness. But this case is nothing of that sort. We aren&amp;rsquo;t even talking about some subtle cultural difference here. &lt;em&gt;Negro&lt;/em&gt; does mean black even in Spanish, and while it is possible that it is used as a regular word (and with less taboo as an expletive) in Spanish, the truth remains that anyone with some amount of sense would stay away from it except in informal, friendly situations. And a match between two fierce sporting rivals doesn&amp;rsquo;t count as one.  I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t comment further on this issue, mainly because any pronunciation of blame would need knowledge of Suarez&amp;rsquo;s personal history, something that I am neither aware of nor interested in researching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insult, as far as I can see, is a function of the insult-er, the insult-ee, and the social protocol that exists for that particular interaction. And you are expected to be aware of the prevalent social protocol of a place. Young people usually use expletives quite liberally, often simply as intensifiers. Among peers, insult is rarely taken, because insult is rarely intended, and this is part of the social setup they are in. A lot of this use is very casual and not even literal—a college guy calling his friend _&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=behenchod&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;behenchod&lt;/a&gt;_ (the Hindi equivalent of sister-fucker) is obviously not insinuating that his friend has incestual relations with his sister (heck, he may not even have a sister)—but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it *acceptable* to use the term with, say, someone senior. You can&amp;rsquo;t say that, back in your hostel, the term is used casually and doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean anything rude. Sorry. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can give other examples. I grew up in North India (mostly Rajasthan). Up there, it is usually considered impolite to address people older than you or more senior to you with just their names. Young people, when talking to guys belonging to the same generation, but older or senior to them, usually address them using the term *bhaiya* (a term that means &lt;em&gt;brother&lt;/em&gt;), and usually add &lt;em&gt;bhaiya&lt;/em&gt; after their name when referring to them in third-person, not unlike the way the Japanese add honorifics like –san, –kun etc. This is normal practice in schools, and often extends to colleges. O&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;f course, this is a simplified picture, and the exact nature of the social relationship between two people might change this, but you get the general picture. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Maharashtra, however, due to various reasons, the term&lt;em&gt; bhaiya&lt;/em&gt; seems to have acquired slightly negative connotations, and many Maharashtrians apparently do not like to be addressed by this term. This seems to be reflected in the student culture at IIT Bombay, and I learnt within a couple of hours of being at the place that you were supposed to address everyone by just their name, and that it was perfectly socially acceptable, and you used the form &lt;em&gt;aap&lt;/em&gt; with seniors. It was obviously slightly weird that a term that usually denotes respect (and sometimes affection too) in the culture I come from would be considered mildly insulting/annoying in my new setting, but this was a part of the adaptation all of us do all the time. For others, it may be just the opposite. It usually takes just a couple of hours or days to observe what works where (certainly not months or years), and probably some time to get used to it, of course, but such cultural adaptation is usual and we do this all the time. I find it rather unremarkable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5em;&#34;&gt;In general, therefore, if a person knows that a particular expression or act is unacceptable in a particular social setting, he should be held culpable for using or doing it. How much punishment it deserves, or whether it deserves any punishment at all, is a different matter. You should make allowances if they have only recently been informed about the undesirability of the act, or give them three strikes or something, so on. But saying that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen this way back where you come from can&amp;rsquo;t work as an excuse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://discerning-transcriptions.blogspot.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ojas Patil&lt;/a&gt; suggested long ago that I write a post about causes of language change. I had forgotten it until E, who&amp;rsquo;s already given me &lt;a title=&#34;What makes something grammatical?&#34; href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=356&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;post fodder&lt;/a&gt; once via a comment on a Linguistrix &lt;a title=&#34;The VanDamme Academy, and why grammar is not about clarity—Part 2&#34; href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=340&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, asked me a follow-up question on my &lt;a title=&#34;What makes something grammatical?&#34; href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=356&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reply&lt;/a&gt; to his comment-question. It was heartening to see that E appeared reasonably convinced by my answers to his first question, and his question is quite interesting—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does language or grammar evolve (Because it certainly _does_ evolve)? I think the procedure would be for somebody to make a grammatical &amp;lsquo;mistake&amp;rsquo; (notice quotes), either deliberately, or inadvertently, and then, for that ungrammatical construct to propagate and become popular enough to be deemed &amp;lsquo;acceptable&amp;rsquo;. Would I be correct in thinking this? We don&amp;rsquo;t really know whether, in the future, _They is going_ will or will not become an acceptable form. So how does one differentiate from something that is evolution in progress, versus something that is just plain wrong? Or isn&amp;rsquo;t there a difference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical Linguistics is a topic that I have mentioned only once on this blog, and have never quite touched upon in detail, so I&amp;rsquo;ll try to give you a fairly broad answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many factors can cause language change, and while I can&amp;rsquo;t provide an exhaustive list, I hope to provide one that is fairly illustrative and representative. Also, all components of language can change. You can have semantic shifts, where the meanings of words change, structural shifts, where the language structure changes. You can also have phonetic/phonological changes, where the pronunciation of words change. Semantic shifts are usually very common. They can lead to words getting broader or narrower senses, and can also cause the sense of words to reverse. For instance, &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt; used to be a positive adjective meaning _full of awe_ but it now has a negative sense, while _awesome_ continues to be positive. Sometimes, a new meaning becomes so prevalent that the old one is virtually lost, like in the word &lt;em&gt;gay&lt;/em&gt;, whose association with homosexuality has taken over its sense of &lt;em&gt;happiness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Languages can change in the process of learning (or acquiring them). Speakers prefer regular patterns, and this might lead to irregular forms slowly becoming regular. An example of reanalysis is &lt;em&gt;hamburger&lt;/em&gt;, which is actually supposed to be &lt;em&gt;Hamburg-er&lt;/em&gt; (coming from the city Hamburg), but was reanalyzed by English speakers as Ham-burger, which is misleading, since hamburgers usually have beef, not pork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can change because of coming into contact with other languages. Often, change is caused due to societal influences—a particular dialect or language feature may get a prestige status, and people might start copying it for social acceptance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of this change might be due to policy issues. Education boards might mandate something, and students, not wanting to lose marks/grades over this start using it until it becomes fairly widespread. For instance, the German language underwent a systematic spelling reform in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can have lexical changes due to plain and simple borrowing. When languages come into each other&amp;rsquo;s contact, they tend to exchange vocabulary. Some languages are particular amenable to such intercourse, English being a glaring example. Some languages (their speakers, i.e.) might resist this, because they fear that this leads to language dilution. But no matter what the French Academy says, people are still going to say stuff like &lt;em&gt;le weekend&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;faire du shopping&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, a lot of change happens due to standard linguistic processes. Words may change due to sound similarity—An &lt;em&gt;apron&lt;/em&gt; was originally called &lt;em&gt;napron&lt;/em&gt;. Because of the similarity between &amp;lsquo;a napron&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;an apron&amp;rsquo;, it slowly got changed to &lt;em&gt;apron&lt;/em&gt;. Similarly, a &lt;em&gt;nadder&lt;/em&gt; became an &lt;em&gt;adder&lt;/em&gt;, a fact that is confirmed when we see that the word for &lt;em&gt;adder&lt;/em&gt; in a related language, German, is &lt;em&gt;natter&lt;/em&gt;, with the &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; still preserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, linguistic processes such as assimilation and deletion that take place in rapid speech get conventionalized to the extent that they start being followed in normal/slow/careful speech too, and a new word is born. An example of this would be if the English contraction &lt;em&gt;gonna&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;going to&lt;/em&gt; were to get accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More important (and, to me, interesting) than the fact that languages change is the fact that a lot of this change is fairly &lt;em&gt;systematic&lt;/em&gt;. If you’ve been following recent posts on Linguistrix, you would have seen me strongly defending language as it is, and so on…, and a few people even&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of order within this apparent chaos. For instance, have you noticed that the contraction &lt;em&gt;gonna&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;going to&lt;/em&gt; is done by English speakers &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; when it is followed by the infinitival form of a verb, and &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; when it’s followed by a noun phrase? Sample this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to watch a movie at PVR → I’m gonna watch a movie at PVR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to PVR to watch a movie → *I’m gonna PVR to watch a movie&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people find contractions like these annoying, probably because they signify a certain lack of respect, or a certain I-don’t-care attitude. How you interpret it is your choice, but be aware that there is nothing special or extra-ordinary about these processes, and a lot of what you speak today, and what you consider perfectly grammatical and respectful today, has come via similar transformations. If Chaucer could hear the way we speak, I am sure he would have denounced it as a horrible corruption of his beautiful language.  Here, I will give my favourite example—consider the contraction &lt;em&gt;gotcha&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;got you&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;betcha&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;bet you&lt;/em&gt;, or any similar contraction where the t+y combination gets contracted to a &lt;em&gt;ch&lt;/em&gt; sound. While you may find &lt;em&gt;gotcha&lt;/em&gt; annoying, the truth is that it is a fairly natural phenomenon, called palatalization, which is pretty common when a sound like [t] is followed by a high frontal vowel or glide like [j]. And if you somehow believe that that sound changes are done only by lazy, uneducated people, have a look at the Hindi word for truth, &lt;em&gt;sach,&lt;/em&gt; and see how it came into being. It comes from the Sanskrit word &lt;em&gt;satya&lt;/em&gt;. Does something look familiar? Palatalization all over again! The Sanskrit &lt;em&gt;satya&lt;/em&gt; became &lt;em&gt;sachch&lt;/em&gt; in Pali, which then dropped the germination, and gave rise to the Modern Hindi &lt;em&gt;sach&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound changes in particular are known to be very systematic and predictable. Since this post has already become too long, I would suggest that you read up about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Great Vowel Shift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm&#39;s_law&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Grimm&amp;rsquo;s Law&lt;/a&gt; if you are further interested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we know if usage is evolution in progress or just plain wrong? It depends on what we are questioning. New words are given credence by their inclusion in a dictionary, which implies that lexicographers have enough reason to believe that the utterance qualifies as a word. Look at Merriam-Websters&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.merriam-webster.com/help/faq/words_in.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;methodology&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. As far as changes in grammar go, it might be relatively more difficult to gauge, but the same principle applies. A one-off, inadvertent grammatical error by a speaker would be just that—an error. But it is certainly possible that errors, whether unintentional or intentional, get picked up. For example, if the popularity of memes make &lt;em&gt;Y u no&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;Why you no&lt;/em&gt;) common enough that people start using it in non-meme settings, and slowly the media picks it up and starts using it, and so on, it may actually go on to become standardized. To that much, most people agree. But would this be considered as degradation of English? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. English is what it is because of similar changes, and such changes in the future would do it no more damage than what they have done previously—none. Let&amp;rsquo;s end with a very famous quotation by Horace, with translations below the original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;multa renascentur quae iam cecidere cadentque&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;quae nunc sunt in honore vocabula, si volet usus,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;quem penes arbitrium est et ius et norma loquendi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many words shall revive, which now have fallen off;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and many which are now in esteem shall fall off, if it be the will of custom,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in whose power is the decision and right and standard of language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

          <title>Pronunciation going awry</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/12/pronunciation-going-awry/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2011 13:55:37 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/12/pronunciation-going-awry/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Christmas is around the corner, and it seems to be that time of the year when you discover you had been pronouncing a word wrongly all this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word is &lt;em&gt;awry&lt;/em&gt;, which I had always thought of as awe-ry, instead of its actual pronunciation a-wry (əˈraɪ).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funny part is that I learnt of the correct pronunciation while reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=544#comment-8240&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;someone else&amp;rsquo;s account&lt;/a&gt; of how he had been making the same mistake (for a much longer period than mine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realize I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard this word spoken—neither by an Indian speaker nor a foreigner. But I strongly suspect that a lot of Indian speakers would also have awe-ry in their heads. How do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;  pronounce it? The comments section is open!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retrospectively, [əˈraɪ] does make  more sense as it fits the general pattern found in similar words. As Dictionary.com explains,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[a- is] a reduced form of the Old English preposition on,  meaning “on,”“in,” “into,” “to,” “toward,” preserved before a noun in aprepositional phrase, forming a predicate adjective or anadverbial element ( afoot; abed; ashore; aside; away ),  or beforean adjective ( afar; aloud; alow ),  as a moribund prefix with averb ( acknowledge ),  and in archaic and dialectal use before apresent participle in -ing ( set the bells aringing );  and added to averb stem with the force of a present participle ( ablaze; agape;aglow; astride;  and originally, awry ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, hindsight is 20-20.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>What makes something grammatical?</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/12/what-makes-something-grammatical/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 19 Dec 2011 14:52:27 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/12/what-makes-something-grammatical/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Someone called E has posted a question in the comments section of my last post—&lt;a title=&#34;The VanDamme Academy, and why grammar is not about clarity—Part 2&#34; href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=340&#34; rel=&#34;bookmark&#34;&gt;The VanDamme Academy, and why grammar is not about clarity—Part 2&lt;/a&gt;. I was going to answer it there itself, but I realized this had enough material to be a post, so here it goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, his question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what, according to you, is &amp;lsquo;unconditionally ungrammatical&amp;rsquo; about _They is walking_? If it conveys all the information the speaker  intends to convey, unambiguously, the only thing wrong with it is the fact that it does not follow convention (the convention of conjugating a verb a certain way with certain subjects)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that is ungrammatical, because it is nearer to the &amp;lsquo;core&amp;rsquo; tenets of grammar, while not using split infinitives is just a _baseless, pedantic, rule with no rhyme or reason_, your choice for drawing the line is as arbitrary as any, innit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way the question has been framed betrays the writer&amp;rsquo;s assumptions or conclusions regarding grammar, and I guess it&amp;rsquo;s there that the problem lies. Let&amp;rsquo;s run through this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If it conveys all the information the speaker intends to convey, unambiguously, the only thing wrong with it is the fact that it does not follow convention (the convention of conjugating a verb a certain way with certain subjects)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because, as I have explained more than once on this blog, being grammatical is not the same as expressing information adequately. The rules of syntax for a particular language are acquired by children when they are pretty young (less than 3 years old), and this happens WITHOUT explicit instruction. These rules are acquired based on external information about how speakers of that language speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If that is ungrammatical, because it is nearer to the &amp;lsquo;core&amp;rsquo; tenets of grammar, while not using split infinitives is just a _baseless, pedantic, rule with no rhyme or reason_, your choice for drawing the line is as arbitrary as any, innit?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, there are no _tenets_ in grammar. Grammar is not a dogmatic system of beliefs. It&amp;rsquo;s not The Holy Bible. It is not gospel truth, and, if you don&amp;rsquo;t mind my borrowing a line from &lt;em&gt;The Da Vinci Code&lt;/em&gt;, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t come from heaven by fax. It&amp;rsquo;s a tragedy of our language education system that people pass through it believing that a language derives its syntax from Wren &amp;amp; Martin and it&amp;rsquo;s vocabulary from the Oxford Dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wren &amp;amp; Martin is written (or at least, should be) based on what the English language is and based on how speakers use it, and the lexicographers over at the Oxford Dictionary still have a job because their work was not over after printing one edition of their dictionary. They observe language usage daily, so that they can continuously update and maintain the relevance of their dictionary so that it continues to be a true reflection of what YOU speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, &lt;em&gt;conjugation&lt;/em&gt;, or subject-verb agreement, is not a tenet, no more than grammatical gender is, or the concept of grammatical number is. It so happens that speakers of English use the verb &amp;lsquo;to be&amp;rsquo; in the form &amp;lsquo;_are&amp;rsquo;_ when the subject is &amp;lsquo;they&amp;rsquo;. &amp;lsquo;They is mad&amp;rsquo; would be considered ungrammatical by native speakers of English, not because there is something inherently wrong with it, but because the correctness conditions of English mandate that you use &amp;lsquo;are&amp;rsquo; with &amp;lsquo;they&amp;rsquo;. Now, this itself is not compulsory. In Mandarin, or Japanese, for example, the verb form does not change with the subject.  Sample this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;我是学生 (Wǒ shì xué shēng) = I am a student = I be student (literally)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;他是学生 (Tā shì xué shēng) = He is a student = He be student (literally)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;他们是学生 (Tā men shì xué shēng) = They are students = He-plural be student (literally)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see that not only does the verb not change across subjects, but the word student also remains the same, i.e. it doesn&amp;rsquo;t go into a plural form. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing universally sacrosanct about verb conjugation; just that it&amp;rsquo;s a characteristic of English (and innumerable other languages).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I am not drawing an arbitrary line about what I will consider grammatical and what I won&amp;rsquo;t. Whether something is grammatical or not is determined not by seeing whether the intended message was conveyed but by looking at things like these—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the construction used by native speakers of that language consciously (i.e. they won&amp;rsquo;t retrospectively claim that it was a production mistake)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the construction well-attested in written language,  including, but not limited to, the works of authors whose writings are appreciated, and mass media like newspapers and magazines?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the usage sufficiently widespread, or is it limited to a community?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If #1, #2 are true and the usage is widespread, you&amp;rsquo;ll usually conclude that it is grammatical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If #1 is true and the usage is widespread, you&amp;rsquo;ll usually say that this construction is chiefly colloquial and is not standard in standard written English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If  #1 is true, but the usage is not widespread, you will usually say that this usage is a dialectal variation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;They is walking&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; is neither used by speakers of English (a speaker of English, if asked, will confirm that it is ungrammatical), nor is it attested in written language, and afaik, is not standard in any dialect (if it is, you can obviously say that it is a feature of that particular dialect). HENCE, it is ungrammatical in English, and NOT because it can&amp;rsquo;t convey information correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, split infinitives (that&amp;rsquo;s what they are called, though more detailed grammatical analysis says that the term itself is a misnomer) are not only widely used in everyday speech, but are also well attested in written English, and are frequently found in the works of the best authors of the English language, and are widespread. This is why they are grammatical, and not because I chose to draw the line there instead of somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this answers your question. If you are interested in this topic, I would very strongly recommend you to read the essay _&lt;a href=&#34;http://people.ucsc.edu/~pullum/MLA2004.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ideology, Power, and Linguistic Theory&lt;/a&gt;_, written by Geoffrey Pullum. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit long, but it&amp;rsquo;s totally worth the time. I will quote a small part of the essay here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose a linguist states it as a condition that in Standard English an independent declarative clause beginning with a preposed negative adjunct must have a tensed auxiliary before the subject:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) a. Never before had I seen such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. *Never before I had seen such a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) a. At no time did he leave the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. *At no time he left the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The claim being made is not that speakers of Standard English OUGHT to position subjects of independent clauses before the tensed auxiliaries when there is no preposed negative adjunct, as in the (a) examples; the claim is that they actually DO position them thus (setting aside unintentional failures like typing or editing errors that sometimes prevent people from doing what they intended). This of course implies that you would be well advised to position them thus if you want to be regarded as using Standard English; but no one is telling you that you SHOULD speak Standard English.&lt;/p&gt;

          <pubDate>Sat, 17 Dec 2011 17:36:04 &#43;0000</pubDate>

          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/12/the-vandamme-academy-and-why-grammar-is-not-about-claritypart-2/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;[This is Part 2 of the post title. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the first part, please read it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=289&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, though this post can be read in isolation too]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important distinction that people often miss out on is the difference between _grammar_ and _style_—the difference between writing _correctly_ and writing &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt;. And this distinction is very important because it&amp;rsquo;s more or less easy for most native speakers with some amount of training in the standard dialect (and knowledge of things like right spellings) to write correctly. Writing _well, _and in a manner that makes the output pleasurable to read, is not easy, and needs years of practice, not to mention exposure to good works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People often get confused between grammar and style, which is not surprising, since school teaching of both is usually intertwined, and kids are usually just told that sentences which don&amp;rsquo;t look nice are just plain &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt;. Probably style is what most people refer to when they say that grammar helps maintain _clarity. _But why does this issue arise in the first place? I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you why—students go to a _writing_ course, expecting to not only learn how to write well, but to hopefully be exposed to good works of literature and learn . However, they are told that sentences that they considered perfectly grammatical and _fine_ in their language aren&amp;rsquo;t actually so, because someone says they aren&amp;rsquo;t. For instance, the previous sentence begins with &lt;em&gt;however&lt;/em&gt;, which many prescriptivists will insist is _wrong. _They will offer no real reason for this, and won&amp;rsquo;t be convinced even if you show them works of good writers who use sentence initial &lt;em&gt;however&lt;/em&gt;, nor will they be ready to disabuse themselves of this madness if you told that this construction has been prevalent in English from as long ago as you care to look , and is used by everyone and their grandmother. The sentence before that contained a _split infinitive, _which is another thing that is supposed to be _wrong_ in the opinion of prescriptivists, and it also contained the word _hopefully_ used in the _It is hoped that&amp;#8230; _sense instead of _full of hope_ sense, which is another of their peeves. When they find no other reason to support these shibboleths, they play the clarity card, or the redundancy card, or the beauty card, or the authority card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Punctuation is also a matter of style. There are some established norms, and they aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily there to make communication efficient or logical. LOGIC would say that a period that actually belongs to the parent sentence should not be placed inside the ending quotation marks of the nested quotation, but style manuals say otherwise. You could find sentences in favour of the Oxford comma, and you could find sentences against it, so don&amp;rsquo;t go doling out drivel about  how it helps resolve ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I am not suggesting that we teach children that writing sentences that are clearly difficult to parse or understand is OK. Children must learn the difference between good writing and bad writing, and be able to improve the way they write, and it is fine to suggest alternate phrasings of sentences where some tweaking might produce better sentences, but imposing blanket rules on kids which aren&amp;rsquo;t even attested in good literature is neither good for the short-term development of their writing skills nor in their long-term training. In the short run, this makes them memorize mindless rules (note that they need to memorize these rules precisely because they are mindless—a _real_ grammatical rule of their language would mostly get acquired before they turn 5) instead of trying to  develop a sense of good writing, and in the long run, it is producing individuals who have their understanding of language and grammar inside out and who will then turn into mothers and fathers who will then train another generation of kids caught in this state of &lt;a href=&#34;http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1357&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;nervous cluelessness&lt;/a&gt;. This is surely not one of the objectives of the VanDamme academy, or of any pedagogic process or curriculum for that matter (though our Human Resources Minister Kapil Sibbal&amp;rsquo;s efforts come dangerously close).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s one big quagmire, and I don&amp;rsquo;t know if there ever will be an end to it. People who try to enforce grammatical rules and _good writing_ in general are looked down upon, which can be good or bad depending on what exactly these people try to enforce. But the argument which is given to them is that &lt;em&gt;anything is OK as long as it conveys the necessary information&lt;/em&gt;, which is silly, because _They is walking on street _is unconditionally ungrammatical in Standard English irrespective of the fact that anyone who hears or reads it will get the information that there&amp;rsquo;s a group of people and that the group is walking on the street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time people saw, understood and analyzed human language for what it is instead of romanticizing and armchair theorizing about what it should be. I don&amp;rsquo;t know when that will happen, but Linguistrix will keep trying.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The VanDamme Academy, and why grammar is not about clarity—Part 1</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Miheer Desai suggested that I check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/user/VanDammeAcademy&#34;&gt;Lisa VanDamme&lt;/a&gt; channel on YouTube for her views on parenting and teaching. I found the VanDamme Academy fairly interesting, and Ms VanDamme seems to be a very passionate person. Her video response to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704111504576059713528698754.html&#34;&gt;Chinese Moms&lt;/a&gt; article was also thought-provoking, and it&amp;rsquo;s heartening to see that someone is putting an effort into improving pedagogy and understanding the ways in which we can educate kids in today&amp;rsquo;s world. As I was browsing her videos, I came across two videos titled _Why Grammar Matters_ (parts I and II), and I was obviously interested in checking out what Ms VanDamme had to say on the issue. I was also pretty apprehensive―I was rather impressed by her videos so far, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to see anything that might change that opinion. Have a look at them yourselves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miss VanDamme is not alone in her views. A lot of educated people, many of them good writers, speakers, or _users_ of the language&lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in general, hold the view that the language people use is an errant kid that needs to be chastised by the rules of grammar taught in the classroom. It&amp;rsquo;s also an important way of asserting one&amp;rsquo;s intellectual superiority—correcting other people&amp;rsquo;s alleged grammar mistakes and saying &amp;lsquo;Gotcha!&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms VanDamme says, and I quote her verbatim—&amp;rdquo;The goal of grammar is to help make our communication, our expression, completely, fluidly clear, for there to be no barriers to the understanding of what we are saying.&amp;rdquo; The rest of her video continues to stress on the same, almost like a record that&amp;rsquo;s got stuck—&amp;rdquo;Grammar helps in fully &lt;em&gt;clear, effortless communication&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo; While this is a common motif that represents what most people think about language, it is quite untenable and doesn&amp;rsquo;t stand scholarly enquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the specific example that Ms VanDamme mentions. LanguageLog already has a lot of analysis on it, but I will quote Ken Wilson, originally quoted &lt;a href=&#34;http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001061.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_Than_ is both a subordinating conjunction, as in &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;She is wiser than I am&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;, and a preposition, as in &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;She is wiser than me&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;. As a subject of the clause introduced by the conjunction &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;than&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;, the pronoun must be nominative, and as object of the preposition than, the following pronoun must be in the objective case. Since the following verb _&amp;lsquo;am&amp;rsquo;_ is often dropped or understood, we regularly hear _&amp;lsquo;than I&amp;rsquo;_ and &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;than me&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;. Some commentators believe that the conjunction is currently more frequent than the preposition, but both are unquestionably Standard. The eighteenth-century effort to declare the preposition incorrect did succeed in giving trouble, not least because it called the _&amp;lsquo;than whom&amp;rsquo;_ structure into question, but it too is again in good order: &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;He is a fine diplomat, than whom we would be hard-pressed to find a better.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my concern is not that one particular example, but the thought process that went behind it. Similar thoughts have been relayed to me in the past. To give you a couple of examples, here are two snippets—one of them is from my chat history, and another from a discussion thread on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://groups.google.com/group/iitb-language-enthusiasts-group&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IITB Language Enthusiasts Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Language comes out of the necessity to make communication as accurate and as simplistic as possible&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Language is first and foremost a means of communication, a means to convey a thought to another person(s), which one should be able to do in the simplest possible fashion.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is a fundamental problem with this viewpoint—among other things, it reverses causality. Saying that grammar helps prevent ambiguity and makes communication more efficient conveys the impression that what people speak or write is inherently flawed or ambiguous or inefficient, and it is grammar that tirelessly helps prevent our conversation from degenerating into chaos. Of course, this cannot and does not hold up to the slightest amount of scrutiny, simply because grammar is and was an account of what constructions of a language native speakers consider correct, and which ones they don&amp;rsquo;t. And when you pick up _any_ language of the world and look at utterances that are considered grammatical in it (if you want, choose the most pedantic style manual for that language), you will realize that languages are rife with ambiguities, redundancies and general chaos. Of course, I am not saying that this is bad. This is perfectly acceptable, and sometimes the redundancies are there for good reason—phonology acts like an error-correcting code, and Gabe Doyle here has an &lt;a href=&#34;http://motivatedgrammar.wordpress.com/2011/11/17/the-reason-why-theres-nothing-wrong/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;interesting argument&lt;/a&gt; about how redundancy in language might even be an asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambiguities are everywhere, most of all in grammatical sentences! Two extremely important concepts such as Yesterday and Tomorrow have the same word in Hindi, and an English sentence like _I killed the man with the gun_ leaves it unclear whether the gun was the murder weapon or merely in possession of the victim. Languages can be extremely polysemous, with the same word having tens of meanings, many of which can&amp;rsquo;t be resolved even if you know the context. You may sit for as many hours as you want, and go through as many works of literature or trawl through corpora weighing in terabytes, and you still won&amp;rsquo;t be able to say that language and grammar were about clarity of expression and lack of ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I understand that if people around the world want to communicate effectively in a language, they should be following the same set of rules, or rather, they should know exactly what set the other party is following—but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that these rules themselves need to resolve ambiguities, and they don&amp;rsquo;t. Even standard English, the kind whose grammar you&amp;rsquo;d see described in grammar texts and referred to by style manuals, is itself rife with ambiguities in construction—both &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_ambiguity&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;lexical ambiguities&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_ambiguity&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;syntactic ambiguities&lt;/a&gt;—and this is in fact one of the many things that make natural language processing a difficult task. You have all kinds of Word Sense Disambiguation algorithms out there solely for the purpose of figuring out what a sentence can mean out of its numerous computable meanings. That languages are supposed to be for _clear, unambiguous_ communication, and that grammar is supposed to be the bouncer that keeps language from misbehaving, is not only factually wrong and empirically refutable, it is optimistic to the point of stupidity.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Two small snippets today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our neighbours have a son who must be around 7–8 years old, the age when kids begin to facepalm over the many idiosyncrancies of the English spelling system. I found this stuck on their front door. What was funny was that this actually looks more like an IPA transcription. Of course, the [n] would actually be the velar nasal [ŋ], the [g] is usually there in Indian pronunciation but not in many other dialects and the second vowel would be [ɪ]. [gritɪŋ] would be more like it. As Mark Liberman said, “The English writing system is a complex pattern of overlapping historical layers with sporadic intrusions of reform, for which the appropriate mode of analysis is more geological than logical.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG035.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-332&#34; title=&#34;gritingkard&#34; src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/IMG035.jpg?fit=300%2C229&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second picture was taken at the State Bank of India branch next to Eternity Mall in Nagpur. Sorry for the terrible quality—mobile camera + bad lighting + bad angle. The text is unreadable due to the glare, but it said _Virtual Back Office_ and वास्तविक बैक ऑफिस. I was a bit surprised at the Hindi translation. Somehow, saying वास्तविक for _virtual_ here seems to me just the opposite of what was intended. However, I am not too sure what the function of a virtual back office is. Probably, it does make sense to call it वास्तविक. If anyone&amp;rsquo;s familiar with banking terminology, please add your comments below!&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;My views on IITB lingo have changed considerably over the years. I used to find it &amp;lsquo;positively revolting&amp;rsquo; in freshman year, and this slowly changed to &amp;lsquo;occasionally annoying&amp;rsquo; somewhere around third year, finally settling at &amp;lsquo;mostly harmless&amp;rsquo;. I am sure reams of paper have been devoted towards discussing campus lingo in general (there&amp;rsquo;s an entire &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.qucosa.de/fileadmin/data/qucosa/documents/5134/data/MAthesis_EvelynRichter.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Masters Thesis&lt;/a&gt; about IITM lingo, for instance), so I won&amp;rsquo;t discuss it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two reasons why I wrote this post, and critiquing IIT lingo isn&amp;rsquo;t either of them—firstly, I wanted to demonstrate how we can investigate simple issues surrounding language usage by using freely and publicly available tools and resources, and secondly, I wanted to talk about how this teaches us to never _assume_ things right-away when dealing with linguistic issues, but to adopt a scientific approach where we try to look at data to prove or disprove our claims instead of blindly trusting our intuition. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was reading _Right ho, Jeeves!_ by P G Wodehouse recently, and was surprised to read this line—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But when he comes leering at Anatole through skylights, just after I had with infinite pains and tact induced him to withdraw his notice, and makes him so temperamental that [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of you may have guessed it right—it was the expression &amp;lsquo;infinite pains&amp;rsquo; that caught my attention. For those unfamiliar with IITB lingo, _infinite_ (and its short form infy/infi, pronounced [ɪnfi]) is used extensively at IITB, in primarily two syntactic roles—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aaj infi kaam tha.&lt;/em&gt; (I had infi (a lot of) work today)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infi sexy bandi hai yaar! :sigh:&lt;/em&gt; ([She&amp;rsquo;s] an infi (very) sexy chick man! :sigh:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In-fye-night-ly lambe form bharne pade yaar LUH, GnP or CTI ke liye (Infinitely (very) long forms had to be filled for LUH and GnP)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_Yaar girlfriend ke saath raat ko sameer-hill gaya tha. Wahaan bhi vigilance waalon ne pakad liya. Ab infinite pain hoga._ (I had gone with my girlfriend to Sameer Hill, but vigilance personnel caught us there too. Now we&amp;rsquo;ll have infinite (a lot of) trouble).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have _infi,_ &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;infinitely&lt;/em&gt;, and prosody is one factor which might make people choose the longer three/four syllable form over the short one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, being surrounded by _infi_ all around, and never  having seen it much in mainstream English, I was drawn to the natural conclusion that it was an idiosyncratic feature of IITB lingo, and any text that uses such a construction would sound non-standard. Obviously then, reading _infinite pains_ in PGW piqued my curiosity. I wanted to find out whether such usage was common, so the first thing I did was use the search feature in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?lr=lang_en&amp;tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22infinite+pains%22&amp;num=30&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Books&lt;/a&gt;. The phrase &amp;lsquo;infinite pains&amp;rsquo; returns 195,000 results. Here are a few examples—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/infpans.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-842&#34; alt=&#34;infpans&#34; src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/infpans-300x61.png?fit=300%2C61&#34; srcset=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/infpans.png?resize=300%2C61 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/infpans.png?w=446 446w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=KQNWgVl37zYC&amp;hl=ja&amp;hl=ja&amp;pg=PA124&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U0i8eCrYPtqKp3peJuUwripku7Nbg&amp;ci=169%2C181%2C781%2C188&amp;edge=0&#34; width=&#34;323&#34; height=&#34;77&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I went to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/&#34;&gt;Open Source Shakespeare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to search for this phrase in Shakespeare&amp;rsquo;s works. I didn&amp;rsquo;t get any occurrence of &amp;lsquo;infinite pains&amp;rsquo;, but several instances of &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt; being used the IITB lingo way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy (Hamlet)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love thee infinitely (Henry IV)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace&amp;#8230; (All&amp;rsquo;s Well That Ends Well)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I used the &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=infinite+pains&amp;amp;year_start=1740&amp;amp;year_end=2000&amp;amp;corpus=0&amp;amp;smoothing=5&#34;&gt;Google n-gram viewer&lt;/a&gt; to look at the usage frequency of this phrase. This not only corroborates previous data but also confirms my intuition to a certain extent—the usage frequency has been progressively reducing over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;&#34; src=&#34;http://books.google.com/ngrams/chart?content=infinite%20pains&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=5&amp;year_start=1740&amp;year_end=2000&#34; width=&#34;450px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, it&amp;rsquo;s best to follow a data-driven approach whenever a language issue is in question. In summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of text, easily searchable, is readily available online&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Books search is a very good way of seeing language usage across 3–4 centuries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google n-gram viewer is particularly useful to observe patterns in usage change over decades and centuries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always approach a questioning attitude towards linguistic issues, instead of considering one&amp;rsquo;s opinion as gospel truth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep thinking!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article is the second article in the multi-part series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?page_id=275&#34; title=&#34;Language Learning Guide&#34;&gt;The Tower of Babel Guide: How to learn any language&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=232&#34; title=&#34;The Tower of Babel Guide (or How to learn any language): Part 1&#34;&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt; dealt with the _whys_ and _whats_ that you might encounter when you decide to learn a language. In this part, we will talk about the kinds of resources you can use for learning languages, and their pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite a few of you might have been taught a foreign language  at school. Learning a language is probably going to be much easier for you—you have already seen the worst. The subtle combination of boring textbooks, pointless grammar drills, bad pedagogical practices and just plain indifference on the part of both teachers and students means that almost all people who learn foreign languages at school end up with the same fate—they may have learnt French for 5 years, but can&amp;rsquo;t hold even the most basic conversation in French or order a sandwich to save their life. A lot can be written on this issue, but I will just quote Jerome K. Jerome:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In England we have a method that for obtaining the least possible result at the greatest possible expenditure of time and money is perhaps unequalled. An English boy who has been through a good middle-class school in England can talk to a Frenchman, slowly and with difficulty, about female gardeners and aunts; conversation which, to a man possessed perhaps of neither, is liable to pall. Possibly, if he be a bright exception, he may be able to tell the time, or make a few guarded observations concerning the weather. No doubt he could repeat a goodly number of irregular verbs by heart; only, as a matter of fact, few foreigners care to listen to their own irregular verbs, recited by young Englishmen. Likewise he might be able to remember a choice selection of grotesquely involved French idioms, such as no modern Frenchman has ever heard or understands when he does hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;
  Let&#39;s begin. Irrespective of what language you want to learn, don&#39;t go about it unless  you have reliable audio material. I can&#39;t stress on&lt;br /&gt; this enough. The first goal you should hope to achieve when learning a language is being able to speak it. And you can summarily trash all your &lt;em&gt;Learn X in N days&lt;/em&gt; guides if they don&#39;t come with an audio component, or if you don&#39;t have a speaker of language to substitute. As a general rule, the entire family of &lt;em&gt;Learn X in 30 days &lt;/em&gt;books that are available for INR 30 in bookstores is useless.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/www.indiaclub.com/Assets/product/images/1255.jpg?resize=144%2C215&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;
  The &lt;em&gt;Teach Yourself&lt;/em&gt; series is good for basic &lt;em&gt;travelers-knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, but I don&#39;t find it suitable for advanced work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.lexiconer.com/chinese/images/0071463410.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg?resize=127%2C180&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;&#34;&gt;Classroom teaching&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good classroom course with a competent teacher and smart classmates is the best possible setting for learning a language, but is usually very difficult to find and is often prohibitively expensive. Usually, courses run by Alliance Française (for French) or Max Müller Bhawan (for German) are pretty good, so if you can afford them and don&amp;rsquo;t mind the travel, give them a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get a native speaker to teach you, consider yourself very very fortunate, and pay close attention to their pronunciation. You have a golden opportunity—make the best of it. If you did a year long French course taught by a native French teacher, and you still say EN-CHAN-TAY and JAY MAPLE, it&amp;rsquo;s you who&amp;rsquo;s a failure, not the course or the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot also depends on your classmates. If they grasp things fairly well, and are really interesting in learning, they can be useful, but you may find yourself in a class where a lot of other people are there for god-knows-what reason, and are clearly pulling the whole class behind. Just live with them. Then go home and study yourself too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-style-span&#34; style=&#34;font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;&#34;&gt;Software/Audio courses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;
  There are two major purely Audio Courses in the world—the Michel Thomas method, and the Pimsleur method. I have tried both of them. The Michel Thomas method is useful for getting basic conversational ability in a language very fast, and is perfect if you want to learn the language because you are going to travel in those parts of the world. It doesn&#39;t dwell a lot on the intricacies of grammar, which is both good and bad, and you end up speaking complex sentences pretty fast. More importantly, it gives you the most important tool—the ability to construct sentences from basic vocabulary.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://i0.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/8959783.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignright&#34; title=&#34;8959783&#34; src=&#34;https://i0.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/8959783.jpg?resize=176%2C162&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the whole, I found that getting to advanced levels with the MT course is tough, mainly because you do need some grip on the grammar, especially for languages like German, where you can&amp;rsquo;t just ignore the entire case system to make it simple. The courses work brilliantly for basic stuff, but it gets difficult as you work your way into the language. Also, you will soon find your vocabulary wanting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another disadvantage of MT courses is that, since they are purely audio-based, you get virtually no reading or writing skills, which gets particularly difficult if you are learning a language with a difficult spelling system, or if you are learning a language with a different writing system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pimsleur method is excellent if you want to learn pronunciation, but fairly useless for almost everything else. It tries to teach language by making you parrot sound sequences, and gives you relatively little synthetic skill, and I find it thoroughly pointless. Pimsleur&amp;rsquo;s way of teaching you _Development_ is by making you repeat _ment, ment, ment, lopment, lopment, lopment, velopment, _You will memorize long phrases and will find yourself dumbstruck if you encounter a different situation, simply because the drill made no mention of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i0.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/rosetta-stone-language-learning-free-sample1.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-full wp-image-304 alignleft&#34; title=&#34;rosetta stone language learning&#34; src=&#34;https://i0.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/rosetta-stone-language-learning-free-sample1.jpg?fit=168%2C168&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; srcset=&#34;https://i0.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/rosetta-stone-language-learning-free-sample1.jpg?w=300 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/rosetta-stone-language-learning-free-sample1.jpg?resize=150%2C150 150w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 168px) 100vw, 168px&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A famous computer based course is the Rossetta Stone. I installed it for French, just to see how it was, and all it did was Vocab drills. Exceedingly stupid and useless. They try to immerse you into the language, but all they are doing is showing you pictures and making you match them with words. If you are a smart person, you can soon tune yourself into the process so well that you can match pictures to sounds and words off the fly without speaking a word of the actual language. Don&amp;rsquo;t waste time over it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;online&#34;&gt;Online&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are loads of websites which offer varying degrees of language learning material, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t found any that is sufficiently comprehensive and interesting.  There also exist websites that let you interact with language enthusiasts around the world—I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried them all that much, since I am a bit wary about opening out to complete strangers, but you can give them a try. There are a lot of websites and blogs and podcasts that offer all kinds of language learning aides. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to review even a fraction of them, but if you want my feedback about a particular tool, please write about it in the comments section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;being-there&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being there&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****This is obviously the best way you could pick up a new language—be where it is spoken! But it&amp;rsquo;s not possible all the time, so I&amp;rsquo;ve an easier way, which works brilliantly if you are in India and want to learn an Indian language. Try a Michel Thomas course one, and notice how he breaks the language into simple elements that help you build whatever you want. Get hold of a native speaker (nicely, of course. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to scare him away!) and try to learn from him by implementing the MT method yourself. I tried this with Kannada. I had a Kannadiga wingie, and I made him tell me translations of basic sentences which I then deconstructed into grammar bits. That, combined with vocab meant that I could construct complex sentences if I thought over them slowly and systematically. If you keep working on this, you will get pretty good at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Up next: Learning techniques and pronunciation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s some happy news on the personal front—I got placed recently, so I am likely to have more money in the future to spend on this blog! And ever since the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; of December, I have been, as Oscar Wilde said, living entirely for pleasure.  From having S&lt;em&gt;tarters only!&lt;/em&gt; lunches to spending the whole night playing weirdass games with friends, it&amp;rsquo;s been a great time so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/The_Dirty_Picture_Poster02.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-294&#34; title=&#34;The Dirty Picture&#34; src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/The_Dirty_Picture_Poster02-300x233.jpg?fit=300%2C233&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; srcset=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/The_Dirty_Picture_Poster02.jpg?resize=300%2C233 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/The_Dirty_Picture_Poster02.jpg?w=480 480w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post-placement decadence, I went to watch &lt;em&gt;The Dirty Picture.&lt;/em&gt; It had fairly decent reviews (some even said it was blousefull), and the tickets were fairly inexpensive—what more can a man want? Since this is a linguistics blog, I won&amp;rsquo;t talk much about the movie. For instance, I won&amp;rsquo;t say that I found the movie fairly _meh_ nor would I say that it was rather boring after the interval. I would also refrain from writing that you might want to consider watching _Puss in boots_ instead. Instead, I would talk about a thing of linguistic interest in this movie. It was this dialogue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Touch toh bahuton ne kiya hai mujhe par chhua kisi ne nahin. (Many [men] have touched [verb in English] me, but no one has yet touched [same verb in Hindi] me)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of you who don’t know Hindi might have said ‘Dude! WTF!?!’ on reading the translation. Well, this is also what Vivek and I said, though we are both native speakers of Hindi, so rest assured that nothing has been lost in translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am aware that all languages have unique words which are often untranslatable into single-word expressions in other languages without losing their essence. A lot of people find this very exciting, and most articles talking about languages usually treat this as central to the discussion. And this fact also tends to be abused by people across the world who start drawing threads of causality between a language’s unique vocabulary and cultural facts surrounding people who speak that language. For instance, English probably does not have a word which means the same as the German S_chadenfreude,_ though we can of course describe it as &lt;em&gt;the joy you get out of other people&amp;rsquo;s miseries,&lt;/em&gt; and so on. However, claiming that Germans are more likely to be vindictive and vengeful than the Britons because of this one word is patently foolish, but this is the sort of argument that you find all over the place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made me question whether the dialogue writer was trying to allude to such a difference in meaning when they wrote that dialogue—and I haven’t been able to find any. The dialogue implied that touching is the pedestrian version of human contact, the sort of contact that comes as an occupational hazard of being a pseudo-prostitute. On the other hand, chhoona (&lt;em&gt;to touch&lt;/em&gt; in Hindi) is the warm, loving and sensual version of the same contact that one would associate with the delicate touch of a true lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who&amp;rsquo;s perfectly fluent in both English and Hindi, I felt that this distinction had been pulled out of thin air. Interestingly, a song from this very movie—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooh la la Ooh la la, tu hai meri fantasy… chhoona na chhoona na, ab main jawaan ho gayi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;uses &lt;em&gt;chhoona&lt;/em&gt; in the first sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as I have often said on this blog, my aim at pointing these things out is not to quibble about language usage à la grammar Nazis. My aim is to look at the reasons why people choose to use language the way they do, and to look at what all goes on in our minds when we try to interpret what we hear or read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible reason is that people associate some languages with _class_ or &lt;em&gt;style.&lt;/em&gt; This is often because using a particular language is a mark of high register and erudition. Take, for instance, the use of Urdu words in Hindi songs. Often, they do help introduces subtle differences in meaning, but a lot of instances of Urdu in songs can be replaced with more everyday words without significant loss in meaning (but with significant loss in poetic value, of course). I have no problem with this. As I mentioned in a previous post, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=74&#34; title=&#34;Whose Hindi is it?&#34;&gt;Whose Hindi is it?&lt;/a&gt;, I am all for such assimilation. But none of it explains the dialogue. So it shall continue to be a mystery to me.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Anti-car toons</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/11/anti-car-toons/</link>
          <pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2011 03:51:29 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/11/anti-car-toons/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s Hindustan Times has an interesting pun (I am assuming it was intentional, though I won&amp;rsquo;t put my cash on it). For some reason, I find it weird, but at the same time it&amp;rsquo;s tough to say why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG022.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-271&#34; title=&#34;anti-cartoons&#34; src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG022-300x225.jpg?fit=300%2C225&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; srcset=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG022.jpg?resize=300%2C225 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG022.jpg?resize=1024%2C768 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/IMG022.jpg?w=2000 2000w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason is that I usually associate the word _toon_ with cartoon movies, not comic strips or paper characters. I checked this with a couple of online dictionaries, and they supported my intuition—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;The Free Dictionary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; toon
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;n.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Informal&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;/strong&gt;A cartoon, especially an animated cartoon.
  &lt;/div&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;/strong&gt;A character in an animated cartoon.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;WordReference Dictionary&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;toon
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;padding-left: 30px;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;noun&lt;/em&gt; informal a cartoon film or character.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I am aware that _toon_ derives from _cartoon_—the point I am trying to make is that the shortened version is more frequently used for cartoon movies or characters and I won&amp;rsquo;t generally associate it with paper cartoons.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I read this, I found it weird that a &lt;em&gt;cartoonist&lt;/em&gt; has been described as _drawing_ what are anti-car &lt;em&gt;toons&lt;/em&gt;. Then I thought it was actually &lt;em&gt;anti-cartoons.&lt;/em&gt; This I can interpret in at least three senses—something that acts against cartoons, like you have &lt;em&gt;anti-tank missiles&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;anti-anti-tank missiles&lt;/em&gt; OR a cartoon that is somehow an antithesis of a cartoon, just like you have &lt;a href=&#34;http://anti-joke.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;anti-jokes&lt;/a&gt;, and thirdly, a cartoon that is opposing something. And I thought that maybe they did intend the third meaning but the guy who did the layout split it into two lines but didn&amp;rsquo;t hyphenate it as there already was another hyphen and the second one so close to the first one would look clumsy. But then I read further, and saw that the whole thing was about a _car-free day,_ so it made sense to talk of _anti-car_ stuff. Including, probably, &lt;em&gt;anti-car toons&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small note of linguistic relevance—&lt;em&gt;cartoon&lt;/em&gt; is a good example of a word that &lt;em&gt;appears&lt;/em&gt; to have two morphemes (minimal meaning elements), &lt;em&gt;car&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;toon&lt;/em&gt;, but in reality as only one (just like _reply_ appears to be &lt;em&gt;re&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ply&lt;/em&gt;, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t, since you can&amp;rsquo;t say _The buses_&lt;em&gt; have begun to reply on the old routes&lt;/em&gt;). You might argue that it probably did originate as &lt;em&gt;car+toon&lt;/em&gt;, but it hasn&amp;rsquo;t. _Toon_ came from &lt;em&gt;cartoon&lt;/em&gt; like &lt;em&gt;infi&lt;/em&gt; comes from &lt;em&gt;infinite&lt;/em&gt;. _Cartoon_ comes from the French &lt;em&gt;carton&lt;/em&gt; which comes from _carta_ which is closer to words like _card_ and _chart_ in English rather than &lt;em&gt;cars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;toons&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.etymonline.com/&#34;&gt;www.etymonline.com&lt;/a&gt; is a pretty reliable source for checking out etymologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, smart pun or weird error? My head is spinning, so I will stop here.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;I have planned a multi-part series on the topic of learning languages. It is aimed at serving two purposes—answering questions around this issue that many people have asked me in the past few years, and putting into words my observations of what worked best for me or others around me, and where I felt I or others could have done better. The series will roughly address the following issues—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why a new language—difficulties—rewards—how to choose one&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to start—where to learn from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pronouncing it well—how to sound good—common mistakes—useful tips—improving your pronunciation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moving ahead—how to start getting a hang of the language—how to cope up with differences—improving your fluency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to keep it once you have it—ways to advance your level—ways to practise—closing remarks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is aimed at being a leisurely read, and I hope it will be a considerable value addition to whoever reads it till the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no fixed posting schedule, though I will try to keep some degree of regularity. But expect at least a week&amp;rsquo;s gap between two posts. I wrote this Part 1 a couple of weeks ago, but expect some delay between Part 1 and Part 2, as I have a hell-week ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;part-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PART 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we begin with &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;, the two important question words are _why _and &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt;, and I would address them one by one—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-do-you-want-to-learn-a-new-language&#34;&gt;Why do you want to learn a new language?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be any of a zillion reasons, frankly. Earlier, I used to frown upon a few of them, but I have realized that there is no point putting value to ambition, so whatever reason motivates you enough is fine. If you are a linguophile who simply loves learning languages, that&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;nuff said, and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to give it much thought. But, in most other cases, the_ reason_ often dictates your overall motivation level. For instance, if you are placed in a Japanese company and have to compulsorily attend 2 months of an intensive Japanese course, there&amp;rsquo;s every chance that you will end up hating it, and deeply regret your decision. If you want to learn another language to be able to communicate with your partner in their mother tongue, you probably have a strong motivation (and you will end up getting a lot of practice too). If you want to learn stereotyped &amp;lsquo;love langauges&amp;rsquo; like French or Italian to achieve linguistically what men in Axe advertisements seem to achieve with just a spray of aerosol, you will probably start off with a lot of gusto, and then fizzle out—not unlike the fragrance of everyday deodorants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be warned, however, that language learning can be a long and tiring process, which often offers close to no reward for several weeks (for relatively simple languages) or months (if you have chosen a particularly tough one). This is probably like learning to play the guitar, another in the list of Axe alternatives, though probably much more common. When you begin to learn, you set the loftiest goals in mind, and you are motivated by none but the best—you want to be able to play that awesome 8-minute solo, or be able to sit with a couple of friends on a Friday night and start accompanying any song that is being sung. But when you begin, you realize it&amp;rsquo;s one long painful process of strumming until your fingers ache and learning to play chords as an academic exercise. It might be weeks before you can begin to play for pleasure  or to a certain level of satisfaction. Learning languages is not entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know quite a few people who want to learn a language with the sole aim of being able to read works by authors they admire in the language in which they were originally written, say German for Kafka, Russian for Tolstoy or Dostoevsky, or Bengali for Tagore. This ain&amp;rsquo;t unlike trying to learn to play cricket because you want to become Sachin Tendular, though it&amp;rsquo;s decidedly easier. You should be aware that learning a language to the level that you can appreciate literature written in it, be able to read it _for pleasure_ as opposed to reading it as an &lt;em&gt;academic exercise&lt;/em&gt;, reading it so that you can chuckle over the funny parts, feel sorry for the characters&amp;rsquo; misfortunes and be able to associate with the tale like you would with a bed-time story your grandmother narrated to you in your mother tongue—is _not_ easy, and will need a lot of time and commitment on your part. It&amp;rsquo;s not trivial, but it&amp;rsquo;s not too difficult either. Get into it but be aware of what you are getting into. And it is not necessarily very cool, as far as public perception goes, so you might not get brownie points for attempting it, unlike learning musical instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the above is not to discourage you, but to give you a fair idea of what you are getting into.  You are likely to be more prepared this way, and will probably be less likely to give it up midway in frustration. Language learning can be a very fruitful process, full of joys and exciting moments. The joy you get when you realize that the seemingly arbitrary sequence of sounds you produced actually conveyed meaning to another person, the excitement you feel when you, for the first time, are able to understand what some random foreigner says to his friend as you all stand in a McD queue, the extremely positive feedback you get from native speakers of a language who swoon even at your terrible attempts at speaking it, the satisfaction you get when you are finally able to sustain a dialogue (unscripted!)  in that language, the respect and admiration you get from friends and acquaintances when you can nonchalantly converse with a native (extra points if the conversation results in them getting a bargain!)—language learning is full of simple pleasures and can be very rewarding. Also, when you learn a foreign language, chances are that you will end up getting insights into your native language too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don&amp;rsquo;t even need to mention what an immense value-addition it can be. It can potentially boost your employment prospects, open a wider range of opportunities for you both in personal and professional life, might help you survive in a foreign country, might enable you to help someone in need, and though I admit it&amp;rsquo;s stretching it, it&amp;rsquo;s not entirely unlikely that it might some day be the difference between life and death. And if you are a linguophile like me, it might be an immensely satisfying and joyful experience in itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;which-language-should-you-choose&#34;&gt;Which language should you choose?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter&#34; title=&#34;Which language?&#34; src=&#34;https://i1.wp.com/www.languagesunited.co.uk/sites/default/files/languages.jpg?resize=432%2C192&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If, after reading the above, you still want to learn a language, great! The next question of course is—which language should you learn? As is obvious, this is directly related to _why_ you want to learn it. Assuming you have free choice, there is a wide variety of questions that you may want to ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you just want to try out a foreign language and aren&amp;rsquo;t very finicky about which one, you could begin with something like French or Spanish. These two are also easy as far as the grammar goes. They are fairly easy to learn, aren&amp;rsquo;t too tough to pronounce, and there is a lot of freely available material to help you learn and practise. They are also very useful because they are widely spoken—in terms of spread, they are second only to English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like grammar a bit, and enjoyed noun declension and verb inflection in Sanskrit, you might want to pick up German. However, unlike French or Spanish, which are spread pretty wide, German is spoken mainly in Germany and a couple of other countries. But it&amp;rsquo;s a major tourist destination and is also important academically, so you might want to learn it for professional benefits. It&amp;rsquo;s also the second most common language  on the internet, if that means anything to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could then go on to more challenging languages—maybe try some Japanese, or Arabic, or Mandarin, or whichever you fancy. If you want help choosing, the website &lt;a href=&#34;http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/e/index.html&#34;&gt;http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/e/index.html&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of interesting information about languages and their difficulty level, and answers most questions you would want to ask before choosing a language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up next: How to start learning—resources—methodology—pronunciation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few important points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have decided upon a basic structure for this series, but have written only the first part yet. If you want me to cover any aspect that&amp;rsquo;s not mentioned in the outline, please add it in the comments section and I will try to incorporate it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please give feedback! Positive feedback makes me happy and will help posts improve, and constructive criticism will tell me what&amp;rsquo;s wrong and help posts improve!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you find this post useful or this series promising, please help it get visibility by sharing/liking it and passing the link to friends who might be interested in this kind of stuff. I don&amp;rsquo;t make money off this blog (rather, I have to shell out a few thousand every year for running it), so the only way this series will go on is if you find it useful and show your appreciation&lt;/li&gt;

          <title>[Why this Kolaveri Di]-u?</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/11/why-this-kolaveri-di-u/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2011 14:05:10 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/11/why-this-kolaveri-di-u/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Since everyone and their grandmother is  busy listening to &lt;em&gt;Why this Kolaveri Di&lt;/em&gt; for the 4157th time in 3 days (What! You haven&amp;rsquo;t heard it yet? Get out from under that rock already!), I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write this short note on a couple of points of linguistic interest in that song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;embed-youtube&#34; style=&#34;text-align:center; display: block;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the extremely catchy tune  that refuses to get out of your head even when you are asleep (I am sure loads of people have this song running like a sinister background score in their dreams), one of the things that make this song fun is of course the strongly Tamil accented English. Someone around me wondered why the heck most of the words in the English transcription terminated in -u when what he was saying sounded more like -uh (अ). In Tamil phonology, this sound is usually the unrounded high central vowel*, a default vowel that&amp;rsquo;s often inserted at the end of consonant ending words (there&amp;rsquo;re some phonological rules that govern the insertion, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know what they are), and which sounds more or less like an -uh (अ) to our ears. The letter used in Tamil for this is a cognate of the letter for u in Hindi (just like the sort of &lt;em&gt;awe&lt;/em&gt; sound in Bengali is the cognate of the Hindi -uh (अ) sound).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many Tamil speakers carry this even when they speak English or other languages—waiters in Mani Lunch Home (a great place for a Tamil meal in Matunga) shout &lt;em&gt;Side-u Side-u Side-u&lt;/em&gt; as they hurriedly carry trays full of plates full of delicious &lt;em&gt;rasam&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;sambhar&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, in my post _&lt;a title=&#34;Poshchim Bongo&#34; href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=44&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Poschim Bongo&lt;/a&gt;_, I discussed how transliteration is a rather complicated issue, and now you can see why. When Tamil is transliterated in English,  they use the letter &amp;lsquo;u&amp;rsquo; to represent a sound, which Tamil speakers will pronounce the way they&amp;rsquo;ve got to, but other people will read as the vowel [u], which sounds completely different. This is often a major impediment in language learning. People stick to their versions of transliteration schemes so religiously that they often ignore something much more important—the way a native speaker is talking. I notice this often in my Chinese course. Pinyin is not the same as traditional English translation of Hindi words, but people end up reading it as if they were reading Hindi words written in English. Disaster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we are talking of peculiarities of Tamil phonology, a common feature in many dialects is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epenthesis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;epenthesis&lt;/a&gt; (systematic insertion of a consonant or vowel sound) of the _y_ sound before non-low &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_vowel&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;front vowels&lt;/a&gt; (like [i] and [e]) and of the _w_ sound before non-low &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_vowel&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;back vowels&lt;/a&gt; (like [u] and [o]) in the beginning of a word. I think this applies to Telugu too (thus making &lt;em&gt;enna&lt;/em&gt; into &lt;em&gt;yenna&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;okati&lt;/em&gt; into _&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqdPRIFu3h4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;wokati&lt;/a&gt;_) (someone please correct me if I am mistaken). So that explains why your English teacher said stuff like &lt;em&gt;Ye, Yef, Yel, Yem, Yen, Yes&lt;/em&gt; etc., to the amusement of many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. I have little knowledge of South Indian languages. If there are any factual errors, please put them in the comments section or mail them to me directly at &lt;em&gt;antariksh&lt;/em&gt; on the domain &lt;em&gt;linguistrix.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.P.S. The lyrics of this song is worse than Rebecca Black&amp;rsquo;s Friday&amp;rsquo;s ever could be. For the last time, stop blaming that song for its lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.P.P.S. Please rate and share posts that you like; this helps them get visibility. If you wish to be updated about future posts, please enter your email id in the subscription box in the top-right or follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/#!/linguistrixweb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;@linguistrixweb&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-family: verdana, sans-serif; font-size: xx-small;&#34;&gt;*Thanks to Prof. Vaijayanthi Sarma for the clarification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The WTF files—Jimmy Wales on Latin</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/11/the-wtf-filesjimmy-wales-on-latin/</link>
          <pubDate>Sat, 19 Nov 2011 05:03:31 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/11/the-wtf-filesjimmy-wales-on-latin/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;The first entry on the WTF files on Linguistrix is supposedly a quote by Jimmy Wales published in today&amp;rsquo;s HT &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Wikipedia-woos-India-with-local-languages/Article1-771140.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;(Wikipedia woos India with local languages)&lt;/a&gt;. I say &lt;em&gt;supposedly&lt;/em&gt; because I really hope that this attribution is incorrect, that this is the result of stupid paraphrasing, and that Jimmy Wales didn&amp;rsquo;t actually say something so hopelessly asinine—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In languages such as Latin, expressing an idea becomes difficult because the language is not commonly spoken and written. However, Indian languages are living languages, where expressing is a lot easier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in quotation marks, and if you read the article, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty clear that this is supposed to be a direct quote (or a very close version of the same). Cicero, and Virgil, and Horace, and Ovid&amp;#8230; your language just ain&amp;rsquo;t good enough. &lt;em&gt;Sorry rahega.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular readers of this blog (or those who read &lt;a title=&#34;The fascinating world of languages, 2&#34; href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=33&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;) would not need to be told what&amp;rsquo;s wrong here—we don&amp;rsquo;t have a Latin Wikipedia not because it&amp;rsquo;s _difficult to express an idea_ in Latin, but because it would be patently stupid to have an encyclopedia written in a language that is virtually dead except in academic circles. It would be equally pointless to have an encyclopedia (whose aim is to make information accessible to the masses) written in Sanskrit, although many Sanskrit fans will tell you that the language is perfectly suited for expressing thoughts of whatsoever kind. Sanskrit Superfans might even assert that the language is better suited for expression of ideas. But it would still be a wasted effort to have a Sanskrit Wikipedia, except for the geek quotient.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Sheldon and Quadruple Negation</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/11/sheldon-and-quadruple-negation/</link>
          <pubDate>Fri, 18 Nov 2011 11:44:31 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/11/sheldon-and-quadruple-negation/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Yay!  A few weeks ago, I &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=132&#34; title=&#34;No reason to disbelieve that this is a misnegation&#34;&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; how a newspaper article in the HT messed up a sentence due to too many negative particles and ended up meaning exactly the opposite of what was intended. On the other side of the spectrum is a dialogue from The Big Bang Theory&amp;rsquo;s latest episode (S05E10, &lt;em&gt;The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition&lt;/em&gt;). The moment I heard it, I whooped with excitement—a perfectly executed &lt;em&gt;quadruple negative&lt;/em&gt;, I thought, just as Amy pointed it out for the whole world to notice. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at this one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those not familiar with TBBT (really?), here&amp;rsquo;s some background. Sheldon and Amy are friends, and Sheldon has firmly maintained  that Amy is &lt;em&gt;not a girlfriend&lt;/em&gt;. Due to what transpires in this episode, Sheldon realizes he doesn&amp;rsquo;t like Amy going out with other guys, and is made to reassess the nature of their relationship, and this is what he finally says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;embed-youtube&#34; style=&#34;text-align:center; display: block;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s simplify it to show that it indeed boils down to the correct interpretation—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend → I am fine with us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend → I think we should stop characterizing you as not a girlfriend → I think you are not &amp;ldquo;not a girlfriend&amp;rdquo; → I think you are my girlfriend.&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=132&#34; title=&#34;No reason to disbelieve that this is a misnegation&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A beautiful quadruple negative, out of the mouth of none other than our favourite character, Sheldon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=132&#34; title=&#34;No reason to disbelieve that this is a misnegation&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; A few people feel that this reduction is not logically correct, since &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t disagree&amp;rdquo; is not the same as &amp;ldquo;I agree&amp;rdquo;. The point here is that we are looking at the pragmatic information conveyed by the utterance. Since Sheldon is hesitant, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to directly make the bold proposition of asking Amy to be his girlfriend and hence tries to convey it using this negative construction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if I say &amp;ldquo;The Big Bang Theory never fails to amuse&amp;rdquo;, I would correctly convey the fact that I find TBBT amusing. If I said &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;The Big Bang Theory never fails to disappoint&amp;rdquo;, I would have made the mistake of putting one negative element extra. The second sentence means that &amp;ldquo;TBBT always disappoints&amp;rdquo;, which was not my intention.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent tweet by Tom Cruise shows us the perils of machine translation and literal translation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://i0.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/tomcruisetweet.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-213&#34; title=&#34;tomcruisetweet&#34; src=&#34;https://i0.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/tomcruisetweet.png?fit=417%2C67&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; srcset=&#34;https://i0.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/tomcruisetweet.png?w=521 521w, https://i0.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/tomcruisetweet.png?resize=300%2C48 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 417px) 100vw, 417px&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The first part of the tweet is of course absolutely unidiomatic, but you can figure out what it is trying to say. But the second part will flummox any reader who is not familiar with English expressions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was obviously the result of English—&amp;gt;Hindi machine translation of something like &amp;ldquo;We are really looking forward to talking to our friends in India when @GhostProtocol comes out soon. Anil Kapoor rocks MI4!&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an important lesson for language learners too. Avoid literally translating stuff between languages unless you have some understanding of idiomatic expressions in the destination language. Also, disabuse yourself of the conviction that most expressions in your native language make a lot of logical sense. More often than not, they don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Sanyam wrote in to ask:  &amp;rsquo;Is it true, that we can pronounce proper nouns as we deem fit?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as I understand from my experience at school, this &amp;lsquo;myth&amp;rsquo; is more a result of school kids trying to excuse themselves of pronouncing English names correctly by resorting to a bogey rule that you can pronounce a proper noun the way you want. Here&amp;rsquo;s my personal take on this—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, I would say, &amp;lsquo;an individual has the right to assert that a particular sequence of sounds (and its corresponding transcription) is their &lt;em&gt;name&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;. As such, you can pronounce any goddamn word, proper noun or not, as you deem fit, but you have to ultimately utter something that a community of speakers will understand and connect to. Most proper names derive from known concepts, characters or stories and have some meaning associated with them. So, there is community wide acceptance of what the pronunciation of the word would be. If you choose the same name, it might be silly to insist that people pronounce it in some other manner. Of course, this community-accepted pronunciation can vary with the community. For eg. John in English becomes Giovanni in Italian; Joseph becomes Giuseppe, and Arvind becomes Aurobindo and so on&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a speaker of Hindi, I know that Sanyam&amp;rsquo;s name is a reference to the Hindi word for patience. So, I know what the name is and how it is pronounced. He can still assert that he wants his name to be pronounced in a different fashion, but then his name wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be &amp;lsquo;Sanyam&amp;rsquo; as people know/understand it.  He can of course assert that he wants a unique proper name for himself. He can come up with a sequence of sounds and call it his name, and then ask others to call him that. For instance, he could say that his name is Fristinum (some random word). But even this made up name would have some pronunciation and he would want people to use it when calling him. It&amp;rsquo;s a different matter that, if people aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with this word, as they won&amp;rsquo;t be if you have made it up, they will all probably pronounce it in different ways, out of ignorance/confusion rather than out of an assertion of their alleged right to pronounce proper nouns at will.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Let us speak our Inglish</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/11/let-us-speak-our-inglish/</link>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;You see, when I started this blog, I swore to myself that I will try to maintain as civil a tone as possible, and shall only strive to increase awareness about a field that I hold so dear. Hold the _lamp of knowledge_ (and a couple of more fancy metaphors that our school prayers taught us), that is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is why I revised the beginning of this post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;text-decoration: line-through;&#34;&gt;What addles the heads of smart Why do people spout absolute&lt;/span&gt; Karan Thapar is a man of great erudition and a delight to watch when he is taking politicians apart with his sharp wit and steely demeanor. But I have  always been a bit uncomfortable reading his pieces on language. It&amp;rsquo;s true that his aim is to just be humorous, but it helps language myths spread even more and I consider it disingenuous. Have a look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/karanthapar/Now-for-some-Inglish/Article1-752581.aspx&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; of his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hindustantimes.com/viewssectionpage/KaranThapar/Speaking-English/Article1-768317.aspx&#34;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part tracks down changes in the English language (how words like rubber, cock, pussy, prick etc. have gotten sexual connotations). It’s a straightforward list, but there are a few things of linguistic interest here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When people talk of &lt;em&gt;language change&lt;/em&gt;, most only think of lexical changes, and it goes with the common (and wrong) simplification that a language __is a combination of a &lt;em&gt;bag of words&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(BOW)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/karanthapar/Now-for-some-Inglish/Article1-752581.aspx&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;need for communication (NFC)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hindustantimes.com/viewssectionpage/KaranThapar/Speaking-English/Article1-768317.aspx&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;. Together, these two assumptions are responsible for most of the misconceptions people have about language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, people are worried about lexical changes because that critically affects the BOW assumption and people sit on their armchairs and theorize about language, ranting against usage that doesn’t match up with the NFC assumption. To me, however, lexical changes are the least interesting. Condoms are made of latex, which is a kind of rubber, so rubber got another connotation. Big deal. Since euphemisms is a big industry anyhow, you can expect to have loads of words to refer to what non-prudes call a penis, mostly deriving from the shape, size and function of the same. Tiny and floppy? Willy. Hard and solid? Tool. Pointy and cylindrical? Prick. You get the idea. Interestingly, though, despite  all these lexical changes, the structure of the English language has remained largely unchanged over several centuries. Once they know some of the vocabulary of those times, students of literature can swoon on reading Shakespeare with more or less the same ease as students of IITs can wince on reading Chetan Bhagat. English grammar has changed remarkably little in the past 400 years. Geoff Pullum has a interesting piece about this &lt;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2011/10/31/permalinks-ensparbulation-etc/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, we are back to the HT article. It continues on about how Americans are destroying English. This is a misconception that at least makes sense if found in the British, because it can ring of patriotism there (as George Bernard Shaw said, “Patriotism is your conviction that this country is superior to all other countries because you were born in it&amp;rdquo;). However, in India, this sentiment can only be ascribed to our long-standing British English fetish. And how does the article say have Americans destroyed English? By saying things like &lt;em&gt;deplane&lt;/em&gt; where Her Majesty would say &lt;em&gt;disembark&lt;/em&gt; (although I do admit I find it difficult to imagine the Queen in the role of airline/airport service staff). You be the judge and tell me which terminology is more transparent. Other atrocities committed by the Americans include saying &lt;em&gt;least worst option&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;easiest option &lt;/em&gt;(do I even need to mention that the two are different in meaning?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The articles talk about how Indians have added to the misery of the English language by introducing terms like ‘pass out’ for ‘graduate’. This is something that I have already discussed in detail on a Google Buzz thread once &lt;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2011/10/31/permalinks-ensparbulation-etc/&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;.  To its credit, it does support the word &lt;em&gt;prepone&lt;/em&gt;, a pet Indianism of mine,  so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now now now. I know it was all probably written in humor. But this is not the first attempt at creating humor out of a bag of false claims and old wives’ tales about language. It would be nice if people who are respected and whose opinions are taken at face value wrote more responsibly and read up about language. And if the purpose of such articles is to merely be humorous, HT has a Sunday column called “Funny Business”. Put them there. That way, people are less likely to take them seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, Tata! I am back to my apping drudgery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. The commenting system in place now is Disqus. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you register! But it would be better if you could comment using your FB/Google/Twitter account&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 11px;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Footnotes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/karanthapar/Now-for-some-Inglish/Article1-752581.aspx&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; This coinage is credited to Geoffrey Pullum who has written about it in many places including &lt;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2011/10/31/permalinks-ensparbulation-etc/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hindustantimes.com/viewssectionpage/KaranThapar/Speaking-English/Article1-768317.aspx&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; Languages are obviously used by people to communicate, so that&amp;rsquo;s not a problem. But there is a problem in the blanket assumption that everything that languages are must be somehow explainable by resorting to an NFC argument. This is a position that just isn&amp;rsquo;t supported by fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://chronicle.com/blogs/linguafranca/2011/10/31/permalinks-ensparbulation-etc/&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; The military term &amp;ldquo;passing out parades&amp;rdquo;  is not restricted to India and is widely used, especially in the UK, whose version of English we love so much. Just three samples that I have pulled off with a simple Google Search:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/o60aXE&#34;&gt;http://bit.ly/o60aXE&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/wbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/ru2sti&#34;&gt;http://bit.ly/ru2sti&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/wbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/oqZc2a&#34;&gt;http://bit.ly/oqZc2a&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/wbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordinated marching in the sun can be quite exhausting, but no one actually _passes out_ while parading. Clearly, therefore, &amp;ldquo;passing out&amp;rdquo; in the sense of &amp;ldquo;completing studies at an institution&amp;rdquo; is well attested usage in both hemispheres. If you don&amp;rsquo;t like it, don&amp;rsquo;t use it, but don&amp;rsquo;t fume and froth about it.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=642736332&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pritish&lt;/a&gt; told me yesterday that, when he posted on a Google Group, he got this message&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Your message will appear in SymphonyxIITB momentarily.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My (and Pritish&amp;rsquo;s, I presume, from his responses)  first instinct was this was obviously wrong. In my idiolect, _momentarily_ could only be used for the sense _&amp;lsquo;for a moment&amp;rsquo;_ whereas Google was using it for &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;in a moment&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/em&gt; Google is not averse to relatively weird constructions as was discussed in &lt;a href=&#34;http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=3264&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; on LanguageLog, so I presumed this was the case here too. The biggest mistake prescriptivists make is considering their own intuition or preference as gospel truth. A typical _Grammar Nazi_ or self-appointed language guardian who had the same interpretation of _momentarily_ as mine would have dismissed Google&amp;rsquo;s usage of &lt;em&gt;momentarily&lt;/em&gt; as wrong (people often criticize constructions they consider &lt;em&gt;Indian English&lt;/em&gt;, unaware that similar constructions are part of prestige dialects across the world). But this is Linguistrix, and you obviously expect more responsible behaviour here, so I did what anyone should do in situations like these—swallowed my _instinct  _and consulted the &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA641#v=onepage&amp;q=momentarily&amp;f=false&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Merriam Websters Dictionary of English Usage&lt;/a&gt; (that I recommended &lt;a title=&#34;Nobody Cares&#34; href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=92&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and referred to &lt;a title=&#34;Who knows about whom?&#34; href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=142&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). One look at the MWDEU, which has a rather long entry for &lt;em&gt;momentarily,&lt;/em&gt; was enough to tell me I was wrong. Here&amp;rsquo;s an excerpt, but I will suggest you read the whole entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i0.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Sans-titre.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-164&#34; title=&#34;Sans titre&#34; src=&#34;https://i0.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Sans-titre.png?fit=339%2C515&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; srcset=&#34;https://i0.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Sans-titre.png?w=339 339w, https://i0.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Sans-titre.png?resize=197%2C300 197w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still feel that the usage of _momentarily_ in India is almost exclusively for the  &amp;rsquo;for a moment&amp;rsquo; sense.  I used Google to search for this word on the Times of India, Hindustan Times and Hindu websites, and checked the first few pages of search results.  All sentences used it to mean &amp;lsquo;for a moment&amp;rsquo;. I don&amp;rsquo;t have more time this morning (what with a formidable to-do list), so I will leave this here. If any of you is interested, try searching a bit more and post your findings in the comment section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New day, new things learnt. Thanks Pritish!&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>All 6 days except Saturday</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/10/all-6-days-except-saturday/</link>

          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/10/all-6-days-except-saturday/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw this at Port Blair airport today, on my way back from an excellent family vacation at Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Language errors on notices and boards are very common and are tracked by countless blogs and humor websites. Since most of these follow typical patterns like spelling mistakes (MISSILE PAAV or anything any IITB Hostel Canteen menu lists) or bad grammar, they are funny but mostly unremarkable. However, I am posting this one here since I have the feeling that this wasn&amp;rsquo;t so much a result of lack of competence as plain confusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_1490.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-153&#34; title=&#34;IMG_1490&#34; src=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_1490.jpg?fit=358%2C269&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; srcset=&#34;https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_1490.jpg?w=448 448w, https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_1490.jpg?resize=300%2C224 300w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px&#34; data-recalc-dims=&#34;1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On reading it for the first time, I got what it meant to say, and you would too, because my mind was primed by &amp;lsquo;SIX DAYS&amp;rsquo;, and was expecting information about which day wasn&amp;rsquo;t included. But, it struck me as slightly weird, so I backtracked, and there it was. When you interpret it literally, you are in a fix. I get a feeling that the person typing the notice was planning to write something like &amp;lsquo;ALL DAYS EXCEPT SATURDAY&amp;rsquo;, but then thought that a numerical quantifier like &amp;lsquo;SIX&amp;rsquo; would emphasize the frequency better, and ended up with this jumble. Alternatively, he might have planned &amp;lsquo;SIX DAYS&amp;rsquo;, and then realized that he hadn&amp;rsquo;t mentioned which day the service didn&amp;rsquo;t run, and added the very idiomatic &amp;lsquo;EXCEPT SATURDAY&amp;rsquo; bit at the end, forgetting what he had begun with. Either way, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be the result of language ignorance so much as a simple goof-up. That is, it seems to be an issue of performance rather than competence.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Who knows about whom?</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/10/who-knows-about-whom/</link>
          <pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2011 17:28:06 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/10/who-knows-about-whom/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Sindhu, a lawyer friend, sent me this on chat:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You should do a post on who v. whom. VERY confusing, I say!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt; to which I replied that she didn&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about it and as long as she trusted her instinct, it was just fine, but she said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, but it is important to know the difference.  At our firm, we are very particular about pristine English in mails to clients.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is the first problem submitted to the Linguistrix Consulting Department, we would oblige with a quick answer. And Sindhu, since you are our first customer, it&amp;rsquo;s on the house!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a general rule of thumb, if an educated* speaker with native or near native fluency feels confused about a grammatical rule, and if a lot of such speakers sitting together can&amp;rsquo;t resolve this over coffee, there is a very strong reason to suspect that the rule is not entirely relevant. This has certainly become the case with the whole &lt;em&gt;who/whom&lt;/em&gt; issue, which tends to flummox people with otherwise impeccable grammar. The _rule_ is fairly straightforward—use _who_ when it&amp;rsquo;s a subject, _whom_ when it&amp;rsquo;s an object. But over the years, and when I say years, I mean centuries, it has always lain in a grey region. If you want to get some perspective, I will refer you to the MWDEU (Merriam-Webster&amp;rsquo;s dictionary of English Usage), which I recommended in &lt;a title=&#34;Nobody Cares&#34; href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=92&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt;. It devotes almost 2 entire pages only to this issue, and there is no point in repeating all that it says, so I will direct you to &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA957#v=onepage&amp;q=whom&amp;f=false&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the relevant page&lt;/a&gt;. Please read what&amp;rsquo;s written there—it&amp;rsquo;s fairly comprehensive. One thing is clear—it&amp;rsquo;s not at all as cut-and-dried as we would hope or imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The status quo is that some uses of _whom_ sound perfectly natural, others sound OK, and the rest sound outright affected and pretentious. Also, _whom_ is not in danger of extinction, but using _whom_ in all cases where you are questioning the object might make you sound very pompous. What should be used where is something I can&amp;rsquo;t advise Sindhu or her colleagues about, especially since I am not aware of what her firm considers pristine English—would splitting infinitives, ending sentences with prepositions, starting them with conjunctions, saying things like &lt;em&gt;It is me&lt;/em&gt;, and half a dozen other mistakes-that-aren&amp;rsquo;t-really-mistakes be considered as wrong English? But if she wants a quick guide to figuring out where one should use &lt;em&gt;whom&lt;/em&gt; (as far as the subject-object definition goes), a simple way would be to see which out of _he_ or _him_ fits in the sentence—if it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;, go for &lt;em&gt;whom&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t account for all the examples listed by MWDEU, but hey, I never said I was giving you a rule to produce natural-sounding sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a mnemonic, associate the &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;whom&lt;/em&gt; with the &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;him/them&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;She loved hi&lt;strong&gt;m → &lt;/strong&gt;Who&lt;strong&gt;m&lt;/strong&gt; did she love?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I slapped hi&lt;strong&gt;m&lt;/strong&gt; → Who&lt;strong&gt;m&lt;/strong&gt; did I slap?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He was slapped by the&lt;strong&gt;m&lt;/strong&gt; → Who was slapped by who&lt;strong&gt;m&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  I have noticed that people tend to not use &lt;em&gt;whom&lt;/em&gt; in cases where it moves to the front of the clause due to wh-movement, but use &lt;em&gt;whom&lt;/em&gt; if it remains in the original position. Compare:
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;em&gt;Who did you talk to? &lt;/em&gt;v. &lt;em&gt;You talked to whom? &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  The second sentence is not grammatical as an isolated utterance, but it can still be expected to be produced in a conversation:
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  A: Who did you talk to?
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  B: So, well, I thought about your proposal and I also talked to Yoda about this&amp;#8230;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  A: Whoa! You talked to &lt;em&gt;whom&lt;/em&gt;?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I strongly prefer this kind of usage, although, technically, it should have been &lt;em&gt;whom&lt;/em&gt; in both cases. This is of course my personal preference. I am not making any claims about its generality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[*I added &lt;em&gt;educated&lt;/em&gt; here because an educated speaker is more likely to be well-versed with the _standard_ or &lt;em&gt;prestige&lt;/em&gt; dialect of a language. Needless to say, one does not need education to acquire any and all the rules of their native dialect.]&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;New day, new linguistic fodder to chew on, and another quick note!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an article in today&amp;rsquo;s HT:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The SC had said that if there is no reason to disbelieve that the accused cannot be reformed or rehabilitated, a sentence of death would be erroneous.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment I read &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;no reason to disbelieve&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;, I knew there was a disaster waiting to happen, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t disappointed. There are a total of 4 negating elements in this text (&lt;em&gt;no reason&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;disbelieve&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;cannot be, erroneous&lt;/em&gt;) and you will see that the meaning is virtually impossible to compute naturally. That is, when you read it without consciously trying to understand it, your brain is likely to not compute any definite meaning. You can of course sit over coffee and compute it element by element. I did that while walking from H3 to the Mech Department, and this is the conclusion (it is paraphrased, so it won&amp;rsquo;t exactly match the statement)—&amp;rdquo;If the accused can be reformed or rehabilitated, a death sentence should be given,&amp;rdquo; which is of course not what the Supreme Court wanted to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this happen? As has often been &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;rlz=&amp;amp;=&amp;amp;q=site%3Aitre.cis.upenn.edu%2F~myl%2Flanguagelog+overnegation&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=#sclient=psy-ab&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;q=site:languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu%2Fnll+misnegation&amp;amp;pbx=1&amp;amp;oq=site:languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu%2Fnll+misnegation&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;aql=1&amp;amp;gs_sm=e&amp;amp;gs_upl=3309l4812l0l6052l11l8l0l0l0l0l315l1779l0.3.4.1l8l0&amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&amp;amp;fp=ec7fae886d32900d&amp;amp;biw=1280&amp;amp;bih=699&#34;&gt;commented upon&lt;/a&gt; on LanguageLog, our little monkey brains find it rather difficult to handle more than 3 or 4 levels of negation, and they just start to shake and sputter and overheat before completely giving up. We then use our intuition to compute the meaning. In the above sentence, almost all readers would assume the sensible conclusion—&amp;rdquo;If there is any possibility of reform, one should not give the death sentence&amp;rdquo;, which is exactly opposite to what ends up being computed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that this is different from sentences like &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know nothing&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t need no education&amp;rdquo;. In Standard English, their truth values would be opposite of the intended ones, but in many dialects of English, including African American Vernacular English (AAVE), they are perfectly grammatical and intentional. And such constructions are also sometimes used intentionally by speakers of Standard English. Misnegation, on the other hand, is when the author intended to convey the opposite meaning, but ended up getting entangled in a lump of negative particles and scalar predicates and produced semantic garble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Misnegation is interesting since it helps us study the theoretical and practical limitations of the human brain in understanding language constructions. It is also very important for lawyers and lawmakers and law-interpreters, who will often find themselves in a fix—do you take the text at face value and derive an obviously wrong interpretation, or do you assume that the law-writer made a mistake and take the meaning that is more sensible? Often, the issue is not so cut-and-dried or obvious as the death sentence one. Look around yourself, and you will find several examples of misnegation in everyday life!&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Black flag-waving</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/10/black-flag-waving/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2011 03:58:19 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/10/black-flag-waving/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Another quick note while I spend my days doing uninteresting things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The front page of Hindustan Times today &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.hindustantimes.com/Kejriwal-shoed-in-Lucknow-1-held/Article1-758768.aspx&#34;&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; another in the series of slipper-hurling incidents that have become quite fashionable in the last few years. This time, the hurl-ee, so to speak, was Arvind Kejriwal. The report reads—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The black flag-waving, saffron kurta-clad attacker, XYZ of Jalaun district, Bundelkhand, about 200 km north of Lucknow, attacked Kejriwal when he was about to reach the dais at Jhulelal park near Lucknow University to address a meeting on graft.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=107&#34; title=&#34;Indian Swedish Embassy&#34;&gt;Two posts ago&lt;/a&gt;, I discussed the conflict caused due to two similar adjectives competing for the same syntactic/semantic role. As I read the above line, my brain stopped at &lt;em&gt;flag-waving.&lt;/em&gt; The reason was that I didn&amp;rsquo;t parse &lt;em&gt;black&lt;/em&gt; as a qualifier for &lt;em&gt;flag&lt;/em&gt;, but rather thought it was qualifying whatever noun was going to follow. This was weird, of course, because 1) With the sensitivity of the whole racism issue, even if the intent was to convey a simple fact, it was unlikely someone would use _black_ here, and  2) In India, we anyhow don&amp;rsquo;t use _black_ to describe people who aren&amp;rsquo;t fair—we usually use &amp;lsquo;dark&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;wheatish&amp;rsquo; or some other adjective depending on which part of the skin colour spectrum the person lies in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a double-take and re-read that part, and this blog post appeared, completely well-formed, in my head. It was clear to me that it was the flag that was black, not the man. And a black flag associated with a protesting man was natural, so it made sense. I still find this weird, because the hyphen in &lt;em&gt;flag-waving&lt;/em&gt; strongly predisposes me to take it as one unit and not assign &lt;em&gt;black&lt;/em&gt; to it. I would write it as &lt;em&gt;black-flag-waving&lt;/em&gt;, but I am not aware of what register this conveys (I have usually seen constructions-like-these in humor/satire or blogs, but it&amp;rsquo;s an unverified gut-feeling, and I won&amp;rsquo;t bet on it), or what HT&amp;rsquo;s style norms are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could argue that the writer would have used a comma after _black_ if he intended to use it as a descriptor of  the hurl-er. That&amp;rsquo;s right in the sense that &lt;em&gt;black, flag-waving&lt;/em&gt; leaves no doubt about what/who is black, but it&amp;rsquo;s wrong in the sense that the lack of a comma doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee that one would necessarily parse it correctly without reading the rest of the sentence, whose structure quickly helps you put all the pieces in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second descriptor was &lt;em&gt;saffron kurta-clad&lt;/em&gt;, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t problematic now, because 1) I had already been primed to parse it correctly due to all that went through my head after reading &lt;em&gt;black flag-waving&lt;/em&gt; and 2) &lt;em&gt;saffron&lt;/em&gt; as a qualifier for a person is not idiomatic anyhow, so I would be forced to assign it to &lt;em&gt;kurta&lt;/em&gt;, where it is rather apposite.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Green Ideas</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/10/green-ideas/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2011 18:22:18 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/10/green-ideas/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colourless Green Ideas Sleep Furiously&lt;/em&gt; is perhaps the most famous sentence in all of Linguistics, given by Noam Chomsky to demonstrate the difference between syntax and semantics—a perfectly grammatical sentence with no understandable meaning, as Wikipedia describes it. I was reminded of it today when I was listening to the song _&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.co.in/url?url=http://www.saavn.com/popup/psong-8Xn1c2xl.html&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=PYaUTrzCEMjTrQec8pzABg&amp;amp;ved=0CCcQ0wQwAQ&amp;amp;q=aazaadiyan&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNELsAalvyc2mKvIvZdQzLcNmuWzkg&#34;&gt;Aazaadiyaan&lt;/a&gt;_ from the movie Udaan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 1985, a competition was held at Stanford where participants were asked to provide a paragraph or verse that could give enough context to make this sentence meaningful. One of the entries, also mentioned on the Wiki page, was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can only be the thought of verdure to come, which prompts us in the autumn to buy these dormant white lumps of vegetable matter covered by a brown papery skin, and lovingly to plant them and care for them. It is a marvel to me that under this cover they are labouring unseen at such a rate within to give us the sudden awesome beauty of spring flowering bulbs. While winter reigns the earth reposes but these colourless green ideas sleep furiously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling seeds green ideas was a rather nice touch, so you could imagine my joy when I saw similar text in the lyrics of Aazaadiyaan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pairon ki bediyan khwabon ko baandhe nahi re, kabhi nahi re&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitti ki parton ko nanne se ankur bhi cheeray, dheere dheere&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iraade hare hare&lt;/strong&gt;, jinke seeno mein ghar kare&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woh dil ki sune kare na darre, na darre&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A rather un-poetic and sad translation would be (my apologies to whoever wrote the original)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manacles that bind your feet can&amp;rsquo;t put shackles on your dreams,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiny sprouts slowly break through layers of soil&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green (green) ideas, (those) in whose hearts they reside&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;they listen to and follow their hearts, they aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether it was inspired by &lt;em&gt;colourless green ideas&lt;/em&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s rare (and very pleasantly surprising) to see song-writing meet linguistics, if only unintentionally.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Indian Swedish Embassy</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/10/indian-swedish-embassy/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2011 05:47:30 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/10/indian-swedish-embassy/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a quick note rather than an elaborate post—I was eating at Shakti (the Women&amp;rsquo;s Cell run lunch center at IITB) yesterday when a group sitting next to me was discussing what they perceived as a semantic ambiguity. The issue was the right term for the Swedish Embassy situated in India. Would it be the Indian Swedish Embassy, or the Swedish Indian Embassy? From what I observed, opinion was divided, but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure whether both sides really computed different meanings or whether one was just trying to play the Devil&amp;rsquo;s Advocate, trying to defend what might originally have been a mistaken utterance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the meaning was clear—An Indian Swedish Embassy would mean the Swedish Embassy in India, while a Swedish Indian Embassy would mean the Indian Embassy in Sweden (if your computation is different, please add a comment). But why does it work this way and not the other way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the explanation lies in adjective order. In English, if more than one adjective qualifies a noun, they can&amp;rsquo;t be put it any random order, but follow a certain semantic ordering. From the Wiki page, the list, which I find more or less correct, and which matches what has been said on this topic in a couple of research papers I went through, is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quantity or number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;quality or opinion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;size&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;age&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;color&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;proper adjective (often nationality, other place of origin, or material)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;purpose or qualifier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;em&gt;two cute old brown wooden grass-eating horses&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case of the embassy, the Swedish in Swedish Embassy looks like #7 or #8, while I can&amp;rsquo;t put my finger at what semantic type the first adjective would be , but it certainly would have lesser precedence than 7 or 8, precedence here defined as proximity to the noun. However, I am not all that sure whether _Swedish_ as a the &lt;em&gt;nationality qualifier&lt;/em&gt; serves the same syntactic role as Swedish as &lt;em&gt;location qualifier&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, the nationality qualifier, at least to me, feel inseparable from the noun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For an example that uses adjectives of type 7 and 8, take _the Chinese German teacher._ It implies that the nationality of the teacher is Chinese, and that they teach German. That&amp;rsquo;s 7 and 8 for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suspicion was that utterances of the type &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;Indian Swedish Embassy&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; would be very rare. To indicate the location, it&amp;rsquo;s common to say _the [adj] embassy in/at_ . To check, I ran a query on the 425 million word Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA). There were 65 hits for the pattern _[j*] [j*] embassy_ (adjective adjective embassy), none of which were of the form we are discussing. The query _[j*] embassy in|at_ generated 597 results.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Nobody Cares</title>
          <link>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/10/nobody-cares/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2011 07:39:17 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/10/nobody-cares/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I am surprised I didn&amp;rsquo;t come across this much earlier.  Jonathan Swift, a very renowned essayist, poet, satirist, popularly known as the author of Gulliver&amp;rsquo;s Travels, wrote:

&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;./wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Capture-297x300.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to read it yourself, you can do so &lt;a href=&#34;http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/proposal.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I would advise against it. There isn&amp;rsquo;t much to be gained, and he&amp;rsquo;s written too much. Jonathan Swift was an intelligent man, and a pretty good writer, so read up his other stuff if you want. You could start with his satire, &lt;a href=&#34;http://art-bin.com/art/omodest.html&#34;&gt;A Modest Proposal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, the moment I saw this article, I knew I was in for a laugh. I will just mention two or three of his peeves. You will see how laughable they are in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have never known this great Town without one or more _Dunces_ of Figure, who had Credit enough to give Rise to some new Word, and propagate it in most Conversations, though it had neither Humor, nor Significancy. If it struck the present Taste, it was soon transferred into the Plays and current Scribbles of the Week, and became an Addition to our Language; while the Men of Wit and Learning, instead of early obviating such Corruptions, were too often seduced to imitate and comply with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cut a long para short, Swift doesn&amp;rsquo;t like new words to be created. At least, not words without any humor or significance. He deplored the fact that many of these words, once they began to be liked by the common masses make their way into plays and into general usage and become an addition to the language. His anger was against men who were of wit and learning, smart and educated men, that is, who, instead of nipping such nonsense in the bud, ended up condoning it and supporting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instances of this Abuse are innumerable: What does Your Lordship think of the Words, &lt;em&gt;Drudg&amp;rsquo;d&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Disturb&amp;rsquo;d&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rebuk&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt;, _Fledg&amp;rsquo;d,_ and a thousand others, every where to be met in Prose as well as Verse? Where, by leaving out a Vowel to save a Syllable, we form so jarring a Sound, and so difficult to utter, that I have often wondred how it could ever obtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t pasted the whole paragraph, but Swift is basically whining against, wait for it, words we currently use as regular past forms of verbs. Back then, the pronunciation had a vowel between the last two consonants, which began to be slowly dropped, giving rise to the present standard forms we all use. Do these sounds jar our ears? Or are they very difficult to utter?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This perpetual Disposition to shorten our Words, by retrenching the Vowels, is nothing else but a tendency to lapse into the Barbarity of those _Northern_ Nations from whom we are descended, and whose Languages labour all under the same Defect. For it is worthy our Observation, that the &lt;em&gt;Spaniard&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;French&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Italians&lt;/em&gt;, although derived from the same _Northern_ Ancestors with our selves, are, with the utmost Difficulty, taught to pronounce our Words, which the _Suedes_ and&lt;em&gt;Danes&lt;/em&gt;, as well as the _Germans_ and the &lt;em&gt;Dutch&lt;/em&gt;, attain to with Ease, because our Syllables resemble theirs in the Roughness and Frequency of Consonants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the basic argument is that English syllabic structure matches that of German, Danish or other Germanic languages, which is hardly surprising, considering English _is_ a Germanic language. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t like vowels being removed from words, and laments this lapse into &lt;em&gt;barbarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;sad&lt;/strong&gt; thing is that trying to force language to align to your personal preferences and dogmas or believing that your version of the language is more mellifluous, beautiful or just plain better than other peoples&amp;rsquo; is not a recent practice. It&amp;rsquo;s been going on since centuries. The &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; thing is that nobody cared then, and nobody cares now. The practices he considered horrible are now standard English (the version that prescriptivists of today declare as mellifluous and logical), and luckily, the minister he wrote to was too busy to take notice. As I have mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=74&#34; title=&#34;Whose Hindi is it?&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=33&#34; title=&#34;The fascinating world of languages, 2&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and in comments on this blog, languages don&amp;rsquo;t need regulatory bodies. Languages are self-evolving and self-regulatory. Language regulation is a failed enterprise. English, the language of Chaucer, considered as the greatest poet of the Middle Ages was very different from the English of Shakespeare which is different from the English we speak today. Live with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market for books and manuals where you can broadcast your peeves and insist that others align your way is of course large—good writing is a very subtle and elusive thing, and can&amp;rsquo;t be learnt in a grammar class, so people get duped into buying books which are useless at best and harmful at worst. Grammar, for the most part, is rather definite and innate. We all learn the grammar of our native language _before_ joining school, and retain it despite grammar education. But this doesn&amp;rsquo;t get us closer to writing &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt;, which is an issue of style, not of correctness or grammaticality. But what takes us even further from writing well is putting our trust in badly written style manuals and taking grammar advice from someone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know his verbs from his nouns but wants to force you to stop using the passive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week, I was forced to attend a &amp;ldquo;How to communicate effectively and blah blah&amp;rdquo; session, for which I had to pay Rs. 200/-. Among other things, the facilitator (Hons. in English Literature) taught us that &amp;ldquo;each sentence in English must have a subject, an object and a verb.&amp;rdquo; He proceeded to give an example. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I am going,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; he said, has &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; as the subject, _am_ as the verb, and _going_ as the object. He then dragged Noam Chomsky into the whole thing, claiming that all this was said by _him._ He then explained how &lt;em&gt;Basically&lt;/em&gt; has 2 syllables—Bay-sick-ly. Not only is all this patent nonsense, it&amp;rsquo;s useless information for someone who wants to learn how to talk in an interview. A person who takes the above seriously will be spending his time counting verbs and nouns and syllables that he can&amp;rsquo;t correctly identify and then worrying over whether he has filled in enough of each kind to make his sentence &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suggestion. Don&amp;rsquo;t listen to self-proclaimed guardians of language. Invest in a good usage guide—the Merriam Webster&amp;rsquo;s Dictionary of English Usage is a brilliant piece of work. It&amp;rsquo;s now &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.google.com/books/about/Merriam_Webster_s_dictionary_of_English.html?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&#34;&gt;available for free&lt;/a&gt; on Google Books. It does what a good usage manual should do. Gives you relevant information, hard facts, and lets you decide. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t prescribe or proscribe. It merely informs you and trusts your intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, West Bengal recently renamed itself to Poshchim Bongo (পশ্চিমবঙ্গ; pronounced [poʃtʃim bɔŋɡo]). Inhabitants of a place should have the first say about what their place is called, so I don&amp;rsquo;t see any problem there. And a community can choose whatever pronunciation they want, as I had discussed in a &lt;a title=&#34;Sanskr[i|u]t&#34; href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=13&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, one would expect that it is worth the millions in taxpayer money that would be spent in the re-branding. Either way, since this is &lt;em&gt;Linguistrix&lt;/em&gt; and not &lt;em&gt;SocioPolitrix&lt;/em&gt;, the political undertones and overtones that surround this issue are the least of my concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What caught my attention when I was reading about the change is the spelling of the new name. Quite a few articles called it &amp;lsquo;Pashchim Banga&amp;rsquo; while Wiki now says &amp;lsquo;Poshchim Bongo&amp;rsquo; and this is the version I find in most places now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, English spelling (or &lt;em&gt;orthography&lt;/em&gt;, since you are reading a Linguistics blog and I want you to feel that your time was well-spent) is a mess. Things are already bad enough considering that most people blame the Roman Script for this problem (oblivious to the fact that the same script does a pretty decent job representing the pronunciation of words of many other languages). But when we use the Roman script to represent sounds of Indian languages, we are already venturing into troubled waters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are various levels to this mess. Usually, when people see some text written in a particular script, they try to read it as if it were a word of a language they know, in our case, English. This leads to common complaints, almost all of which follow the same template—that the spelling system of X is dumb, where X could be French, or German, or Finnish, or whatever. Never mind the irony of an English speaker calling any other spelling system dumb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since we are already used to the transliteration system followed for Hindi or other Indian languages, we largely use our knowledge of the language to pronounce Hindi names written in English. If we were to really look at the transliteration system we use, there are loads of inconsistencies, which are simply ignored because we know what the word is supposed to mean. But try to see a guy pronounce names/surnames not familiar to him, and you will know what chaos ensues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is usual in European languages to modify Biblical names—Michael becomes Miguel in Spanish, Joseph becomes Giuseppe in Italian and so on, usually as per the phonological rules of the new language. This happens in India too, to a certain extent. Arvind (अरविंद) becomes Aurobindo (অরবিন্দ) in Bengali, the spelling matching one-to-one, more or less, while the pronunciation is the way one would pronounce a Bengali word with that spelling. The advantage of writing Aurobindo is that when I pronounce it, I would pronounce it more or less in the Bengali way, which sounds fair enough. But more often that not, Bengalis use the Hindi version when spelling their name in English, with the effect that most non-Bengali speakers mispronounce it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both approaches have their pros and cons. Spelling it phonetically preserves the native pronunciation, while spelling it the same way across languages helps in preserving the fact that &lt;em&gt;Arvind&lt;/em&gt; and _Aurobindo_ represent the same concept. For instance, I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize for many years that _Kajol_ was actually the Bengali way of saying &lt;em&gt;Kajal.&lt;/em&gt; Also, when I have what is essentially the same name/surname spelt in a number of ways, any statistical analysis I do has to begin with a way to normalize the spellings. Agrawal is sometimes spelt as Agarwal, the reason being that those people pronounce it as Agarwal, which I would readily accept if they agreed to spell it as अगरवाल in Hindi, but that would never happen, of course. Chaudhary is sometimes spelt Choudhary and sometimes Chaudhari but Tiwari is seldom Tiwary. Mayur has a ‘bade u ki maatra’, so it should have been Mayoor, but it isn’t. _X_ is sometimes used for क्ष as in Laxmi or Xitij, which is unusual, considering that in English, and in most other Hindi words, &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; corresponds to [ks].  And when you bring South Indian names into the fray, you add to the hilarity. While the North Indian system uses the letter ‘h’ after stop consonants to denote aspiration, the usual norm in South India is to use the ‘h’ to denote change of place of articulation from retroflex to dental (&lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; is ट and &lt;em&gt;th&lt;/em&gt; is त, likewise for &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dh&lt;/em&gt;). North Indians, not familiar with this system, laugh at what they feel is चैथन्य or श्वेथा. My father&amp;rsquo;s name was spelt by his South Indian colleagues as &lt;em&gt;Vinodh&lt;/em&gt;, perfectly consistent with their transliteration system, but funny for North-Indians nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solutions? Erm, nothing much. We have been managing pretty fine, frankly. But yeah, I am tempted to suggest using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;IPA&lt;/a&gt;. Now that would be real cute and über-geeky, but I know it&amp;rsquo;s never going to pull off&amp;#8230; sigh.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[This article has undergone a few edits after being published. I see that the whole discussion is revolving around issues peripheral to the theme of the post. In this post, I am denouncing the concept of purity being attached to Sanskritized Hindi, so I have removed bits I care less about and which are not directly relevant to the issue.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14th September is celebrated in India as &lt;em&gt;Hindi Divas&lt;/em&gt; (हिंदी दिवस). Foreigners often find it weird that India needs to celebrate &amp;lsquo;Hindi Day&amp;rsquo;—one doesn&amp;rsquo;t usually hear of &amp;lsquo;French (language) Day&amp;rsquo; being celebrated in France or &amp;lsquo;English Day&amp;rsquo; being celebrated in England. But in a country like India with no single linguistic identity, days like this make a reasonable amount of sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, among many programs that will be held around the country today will be programs to promote what is called Shuddha Hindi (शुद्ध हिंदी). To put it simply, &lt;em&gt;Shuddha Hindi&lt;/em&gt;, which I will call SH in this post, is Hindi that has been stripped of all words that do not derive from Sanskrit. There will be &lt;em&gt;Shuddha Hindi&lt;/em&gt; speech competitions, where points will be docked off for every single use of a word of Arabic or Persian origin. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I am wrong in guessing that somewhere in the country, people would be handing out SH glossaries to help you purify your language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In SH, words like मौका or तोहफ़ा or phrases like आम तौर पर are down-market—अवसर, उपहार and साधारणतः is what they should be. Proponents of SH claim that non-SH forms are a result of the bastardization which has corrupted our pure &lt;em&gt;matrubhasha&lt;/em&gt;, the one which has its origin in the glorious language of Gods, our very own &lt;em&gt;Sanskrut&lt;/em&gt;. I extend my full support to any activities that are for promotion of Hindi among our people but I am sorry I can&amp;rsquo;t be guilty of this linguistic imperialism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whose Hindi is &lt;em&gt;Shuddh Hindi&lt;/em&gt;? It&amp;rsquo;s certainly not the Hindi that popular media uses—Bollywood has largely embraced Hindi-Urdu, whose vocabulary can be adjusted to choose the target register or dialect. Bollywood songs use Hindi-Urdu. We speak Hindi-Urdu. Nor is Shuddha Hindi the Hindi that Premchand, arguably the most famous and prolific Hindi-Urdu writer of the 20th century wrote. A quick look at any Munshi Premchand piece will show that he used both Sanskritized and loan-words in his writings. Whose Hindi is it? Hardly anyone associates with it, and many have trouble even understanding it. Around the world, a lot of political issues have language at the core—the whole Catalan v/s Castillian Spanish is a prime example—but those people fight so that their version of the language gets official recognition. In India, we have movements to go back to a version no-one uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two issues here, not one—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The imposition of a so-called prestige dialect. This is wrong but it&amp;rsquo;s often necessary for purposes of standardization. Please note, however, that standardization can exist without imposition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The idea that Sanskritized Hindi is superior. This is what I have a greater problem with. To believe and propound that Sankritized Hindi is the true Hindi, as Arvind explained in his comment below, is to ignore the very development of the language and cast a blind eye to the fact that the Hindi we speak today is no more Sanskrit than the English we speak today is Latin. Sanskritized Hindi is NOT some extinct language that we need to &amp;lsquo;preserve&amp;rsquo;. As a point of academic interest, we could maybe maintain a distinction, of course, but believing that you are doing some sort of linguistic preservation by trying to uphold Sanskritized Hindi is just plain delusional. Of course if the situation merits it, choose a more Sanskrit register—Mahabharat&amp;rsquo;s characters, assuming they existed, never spoke Hindi, let alone a Sanskritized one. But it makes sense for them to speak SH on television as the language of that time couldn&amp;rsquo;t have had the influence of Urdu, Persian, Arabic etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proponents of SH lament the influence of the Mughal empire on Hindi, which brought about a significant change in the language. Hindi, according to them, should only be the Sansritized version. It&amp;rsquo;s bad enough that Sanskrit has to bear all the faux-linguistic stupidity that is piled upon it, but please keep religio-political propaganda out of a language that a significant proportion of our population speaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also probably why most organizations that seem to work for the promotion of Hindi never manage to reach their target audience. They seem to be full of a bunch of snobs forever stuck up with some antiquated version of the language that nobody uses nor associates with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to know why I care? I like Hindi. I like the language, and would want it to be promoted so that more people can associate with it (that&amp;rsquo;s different from shoving the language down or up people&amp;rsquo;s alimentary canal just so that they speak it). But as long as people stick around with this atavistic attitude, I am only going to cringe at the thought of being associated with a pro-Hindi organization.&lt;/p&gt;

          <pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2011 17:38:29 &#43;0000</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://linguistrix.github.io/2011/09/sanskriut/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have observed that most speakers of Hindi pronounce ऋ as essentially रि [rɪ] thus pronouncing words like ऋषभ or कृषि or आकृति as रिषभ, क्रिषि and आक्रिति respectively while speakers of Marathi and Gujarati pronounce it as रु [rʊ] thus saying रुषभ, क्रुषि and आक्रुती. It is a completely different matter that most Hindi speakers do not pronounce ष as a distinct sound. They use the same sound for ष and श, roughly the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voiceless_palato-alveolar_sibilant&#34;&gt;voiceless post-alveolar fricative&lt;/a&gt;, which also explains why most of us spent a lot of sweat and blood in memorizing when a word had श and when it had ष—there were no phonetic clues to differentiate between what was essentially a spelling distinction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I digress. Let&amp;rsquo;s get back to the slippery ऋ business. Quite a few Marathi speakers believe that their pronunciation is more superior or more-correct, so to speak, compared to the Hindi counterpart. While a community can choose whatever pronunciation it wants for a character, out of academic interest, I tried to investigate the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s try to look at what ऋ really is. ऋ is usually called a syllabic consonant, meaning that it acts as the nucleus of a syllable. To understand it better, look at the word *button* (click &lt;a href=&#34;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/button&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and listen to the pronunciation). You&amp;rsquo;d notice that there is no audible vowel sound after [t]. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t work if you pronounce it with an Indian accent, so check out the pronunciation I have given the link to. Despite there being no vowel sound after [t], you get the feeling that the word has two syllables. That&amp;rsquo;s because the [n] sound here acts like a syllabic consonant, that is, it is the nucleus of the second syllable [tn]. We usually associate syllables with vowels, so it seems weird to see a consonant making a syllable, but it&amp;rsquo;s perfectly normal—syllables are usually interpreted based on peaks of sonority, and sufficiently sonorous sounds like [m, n, r, l] can also act as syllable nuclei. Look at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bottle&#34;&gt;pronunciation&lt;/a&gt; of the word &lt;em&gt;bottle&lt;/em&gt;, for instance. Here [l] is acting like a syllabic consonant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s put this into perspective. ऋ is supposed to be a syllabic consonant, so it won&amp;rsquo;t have a vowel with it and, going by the definition, that rules out both variants [rʊ, rɪ]. As a community, speakers of Marathi have ended up choosing one, while Hindi speakers have chosen another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does ऋ sound like? I have never heard Vedic Sanskrit spoken by a native speaker, but thankfully, we have modern languages that routinely use syllabic consonants. Czech has a tongue twister &lt;em&gt;Strč prst skrz krk&lt;/em&gt; that has no vowels—just four syllables with &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; in a syllabic role. Click &lt;a href=&#34;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Prst_a_krk.ogg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the pronunciation of this sentence by a native speaker. Here&amp;rsquo;s another video of a guy explaining the tongue twister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the bottom line? That it&amp;rsquo;s perfectly OK to call ऋ either रु or रि; while one of the two might sound slightly closer to the actual ऋ, neither pronunciation probably matches it exactly. It does&amp;rsquo;t matter either way. And there is really no point in calling one pronunciation superior to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[This is the continuation of a  series of articles on Languages and Linguistics that I am writing for a magazine for school kids, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/pages/Education-Edge-Magazine/241947022508238&#34;&gt;EducationEdge&lt;/a&gt;, that a friend of mine has started recently. These articles are targeted at students of classes VIII to XII. I will keep posting those articles on Linguistrix once they are published. The first article can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=25&#34; title=&#34;The fascinating world of languages, Article 1&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous article, I introduced you to Linguistics and discussed a few examples from various fields within this discipline. This time, we shall move ahead and look at how languages are looked at from an analytical point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In school days, language is synonymous with having to learn grammar rules, do pointless transformations (convert a complex sentence into a compound sentence, or convert to/from passive voice, or insert appropriate clauses etc.) It also brings bad memories to most students who manage to score close to full marks in all other subjects but are always thwarted by English/Hindi. Linguistics, thankfully, is much more fun and is a lot more analytical. Whatever language education you have had so far has mostly emphasized on &lt;em&gt;correctness&lt;/em&gt;. The emphasis was on writing correct stuff, and to this tune, you were taught rules and your knowledge of these rules was tested, graded and so on. But linguistics doesn’t care about what a style manual or a grammar text &lt;em&gt;dictates&lt;/em&gt; about language—it looks at evidence in the form of what native speakers consider grammatical in their language. If you look at the language you have acquired, you will realize that most of the &lt;em&gt;rules&lt;/em&gt; that you seem to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; were never explicitly told to you. Sample this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who did you give the book to?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it sound correct to your ears? It mostly did. However, if you look from the point of view of prescriptive grammar books which try to impose upon you certain constructions (and ban others) without fact-checking them with native usage, this sentence has not one but two &lt;em&gt;errors.&lt;/em&gt; Hard-core prescriptivists will tell you that the first word &lt;em&gt;has to be&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;whom&lt;/em&gt; and that you couldn’t end a sentence with a preposition like &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;. According to them, the correct sentence would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To whom did you give the book?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s consider another sentence. Read it out and ask yourself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To whom you give did book the?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That almost hurt, right? This is clearly an ungrammatical sentence. However, if you look at your language education, you were rarely taught sentence structure and syntax in detail, but can still very easily figure out the ungrammaticality. Why is this so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speakers of a community acquire the language used by that community as it is, without incorporating silly biases about what language &lt;em&gt;should be&lt;/em&gt; according to a group of curmudgeonly prescriptivists. You grew up with speakers of the language who rarely made a distinction between &lt;em&gt;who/whom&lt;/em&gt; and who frequently put prepositions at the end of their sentences, because this is how their language works. How do we decide what is called grammatical and what isn’t? We look at data. We see the writings of good authors, look at usage of the language in mass media and on the internet, look at corpora (data banks) of conversations between native speakers. A good dictionary or usage book takes into account all of these things and presents bare facts to you, and then let’s you decide what best fits what you want to convey. Let’s summarize the facts. Languages are &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Necessarily logical—Just because multiplying two negatives numbers in Maths gives you a positive number does not mean that using two negatives in a sentence will necessarily give you a positive sentence. In Standard English, yes, but not in many other dialects of English, nor in languages like French. &lt;em&gt;Trousers&lt;/em&gt; constitute one piece of garment, but the word is plural, while &lt;em&gt;bikini&lt;/em&gt;, constituting two separate pieces of garment, is still singular. That being said, while language may have such &lt;em&gt;flaws&lt;/em&gt; based on everyday logic, the sub-stratum is still very structured and can be analyzed, as we will discuss in subsequent articles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Necessarily optimal/space efficient—the word &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;I think (that) he is not well&lt;/em&gt; is optional, so, from considerations of space efficiency, there would be no point using it. Such logic does not work. Speakers are still free to use either of the two sentences and they are &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; perfectly grammatical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Superior to other languages—there is nothing inherently superior about &lt;em&gt;Standard English&lt;/em&gt; or about &lt;em&gt;Standard Hindi&lt;/em&gt;, the kind we are taught as &lt;em&gt;correct&lt;/em&gt;. What dialect of a language gets to be considered as the &lt;em&gt;prestige&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;dialect&lt;/em&gt; (a dialect which is considered as posh or educated or whose speakers are considered respectable) is a socio-political issue, not a linguistic one. All of the (close to) 6000 languages of the world show the same kind of underlying structure, whether they are spoken by people of developed nations or tribes in the Andamans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list of a few &lt;em&gt;rules of English&lt;/em&gt; which are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; actually rules:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t split infinitives—it is perfectly grammatical (and often stylistically preferable) to insert an adverb between &lt;strong&gt;to&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;verb&lt;/strong&gt;. Eg&lt;em&gt;. …to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t start sentences with conjunctions—it is perfectly fine to do so as long as you don’t create clumsy or fragmental sentences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t end sentences with prepositions—it is grammatical in English to do so. Eg. &lt;em&gt;What do you want the book for?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, please note that many teachers and editors might still insist that you follow these and several other silly rules. If your teacher/education board wants you to follow them, please do so, but please also keep in mind the spirit of looking at language in a scientific way.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
  [I am writing a series of articles on Languages and Linguistics for a magazine for school kids, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/pages/Education-Edge-Magazine/241947022508238&#34;&gt;EducationEdge&lt;/a&gt;, that a friend of mine has started recently. These articles are targeted at students of classes VIII to XII. I will keep posting those articles on Linguistrix once they are published. Here&#39;s the first in the series.]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Those who know nothing of foreign languages know nothing of their own.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;
  —Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&#34;text-align: left;&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;
  Every human possesses an innate ability to acquire language. Linguistics is a fascinating field that studies how languages work and explores the underlying similarities between languages. This also gives us a lot of understanding about how the brain works. Although languages come in all kinds, you can find many patterns that suggest that the underlying &lt;em&gt;machinery&lt;/em&gt; of languages is the same. A Linguist, therefore, is not a person who learns many languages—rather, he is concerned with studying how languages work.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phonetics and phonology, for example, deal with the sounds used by the speakers of a language. Let’s examine a very common rule of English—you have been taught that &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; appears before vowel sounds while &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; precedes consonant sounds. Can you think of any other language with a similar rule? Look at the Hindi prefix अ- that is often added to words to negate them. For example, हिंसा changes to अहिंसा. Now, apply this prefix to अर्थ. अअर्थ doesn’t quite sound right, does it? The correct word is अनर्थ! Before a vowel sound, the अ- changed to अन्. But wait, that’s exactly what English does! Looks like the rule isn’t as arbitrary as we previously thought! As it is difficult to pronounce two vowels when they come together like this (try it!), many languages try to resolve this problem, called hiatus, by inserting a consonant or removing one of the vowels. Now look at all the स्वर-संधि rules you learnt in Sanskrit/Hindi… all they do is remove this hiatus. Recall यण् संधि. It asks you to change a sequence of इ and अ to य. Why not to any other consonant? Test it out yourself. Speak a sequence of इ and अ sounds continuously without giving a break (इअइअइअइअइअ&amp;#8230;). You will hear yourself saying यययय&amp;#8230; Such rules, therefore, merely document what really happens during speech production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we learn Grammar in school, we are given the impression that the grammar of a language defines what it is and what it should do. The truth is actually the opposite. Grammar textbooks merely attempt to describe what native speakers of a language speak. You may have noticed that you were fluent in your mother-tongue long before you were taught its grammar in school. If you lost marks in grammar, it was not because you didn’t know your language, but because you couldn’t care less about what nouns, adverbs or clauses were. It is interesting to find out &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; people speak the way they do and how they acquire rules regarding the same. By age 3-4, most kids acquire almost all commonly used rules of their language which usually take foreign speakers years to master. Acquiring does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean merely listening and memorizing—my 2½ year old nephew, for example, says मैं जाया instead of मैं गया, despite hearing the correct form from his elders. This is because he has acquired the rule that makes regular past forms in Hindi (eg. खाना—खाया, लाना—लाया). As गया is an exception, it is specially learnt later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The field of Historical Linguistics studies the changes that occur in languages over a period of time—word meanings change, some words drop out of usage while new ones are created. Linguists believe, for example, that Indian languages and European languages had a common ancestor. You can see how the word for the number 3 has very similar words in these languages (three, tres, tre, trois, teen, treeni etc.). English first had two second person pronouns—thou (informal) and you (formal/many), similar to तुम and आप.  Slowly, &lt;em&gt;thou&lt;/em&gt; dropped out of usage, just &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; was left.  But it is still preserved in German—compare &lt;em&gt;thou goe&lt;strong&gt;st&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; **&lt;strong&gt;(Old English) with _du geh&lt;/strong&gt;st**_ (German)&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study of Language and linguistics is very enriching and fun-filled. Apart from opening our door to cultures, it makes us more broad-minded and helps us appreciate the similarities in the fascinating diversity of our languages and thought-process. Several studies have shown that bilingualism/multilingualism has several cognitive benefits. Its practical/social benefits are well known—speaking to people in their language warms them up and knowing the local language can often be a tourist’s biggest asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t tried to learn any language other than your mother-tongue and English, give it a shot. You won’t regret it! If this article interested you, do read up on this on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog has been in the proverbial pipeline for the past 3–4 months now, and after spending a lot of time on possible names, I finalized what was actually the first name that came to my mind—Linguistrix. I won&amp;rsquo;t explain the funda—if you don&amp;rsquo;t get it, it isn&amp;rsquo;t anything great anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhow, the blog&amp;rsquo;s all set up, and I will hopefully start posting soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog apparently supports LaTeX off the fly! And I am trying to figure out a way to type IPA easily too. Once that&amp;rsquo;s done, we&amp;rsquo;ll be all set.&lt;/p&gt;
