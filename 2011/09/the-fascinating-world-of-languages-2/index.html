The first article can be found <a href="http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=25" title="The fascinating world of languages, Article 1">here</a>.]</em></p>

<p>In the previous article, I introduced you to Linguistics and discussed a few examples from various fields within this discipline. This time, we shall move ahead and look at how languages are looked at from an analytical point of view.</p>

<p>In school days, language is synonymous with having to learn grammar rules, do pointless transformations (convert a complex sentence into a compound sentence, or convert to/from passive voice, or insert appropriate clauses etc.) It also brings bad memories to most students who manage to score close to full marks in all other subjects but are always thwarted by English/Hindi. Linguistics, thankfully, is much more fun and is a lot more analytical. Whatever language education you have had so far has mostly emphasized on <em>correctness</em>. The emphasis was on writing correct stuff, and to this tune, you were taught rules and your knowledge of these rules was tested, graded and so on. But linguistics doesn’t care about what a style manual or a grammar text <em>dictates</em> about language—it looks at evidence in the form of what native speakers consider grammatical in their language. If you look at the language you have acquired, you will realize that most of the <em>rules</em> that you seem to <em>know</em> were never explicitly told to you. Sample this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who did you give the book to?</li>
</ul>

<p>Does it sound correct to your ears? It mostly did. However, if you look from the point of view of prescriptive grammar books which try to impose upon you certain constructions (and ban others) without fact-checking them with native usage, this sentence has not one but two <em>errors.</em> Hard-core prescriptivists will tell you that the first word <em>has to be</em> <em>whom</em> and that you couldn’t end a sentence with a preposition like <em>to</em>. According to them, the correct sentence would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>To whom did you give the book?</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, let’s consider another sentence. Read it out and ask yourself</p>

<ul>
<li>To whom you give did book the?</li>
</ul>

<p>That almost hurt, right? This is clearly an ungrammatical sentence. However, if you look at your language education, you were rarely taught sentence structure and syntax in detail, but can still very easily figure out the ungrammaticality. Why is this so?</p>

<p>Speakers of a community acquire the language used by that community as it is, without incorporating silly biases about what language <em>should be</em> according to a group of curmudgeonly prescriptivists. You grew up with speakers of the language who rarely made a distinction between <em>who/whom</em> and who frequently put prepositions at the end of their sentences, because this is how their language works. How do we decide what is called grammatical and what isn’t? We look at data. We see the writings of good authors, look at usage of the language in mass media and on the internet, look at corpora (data banks) of conversations between native speakers. A good dictionary or usage book takes into account all of these things and presents bare facts to you, and then let’s you decide what best fits what you want to convey. Let’s summarize the facts. Languages are <strong>not</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Necessarily logical—Just because multiplying two negatives numbers in Maths gives you a positive number does not mean that using two negatives in a sentence will necessarily give you a positive sentence. In Standard English, yes, but not in many other dialects of English, nor in languages like French. <em>Trousers</em> constitute one piece of garment, but the word is plural, while <em>bikini</em>, constituting two separate pieces of garment, is still singular. That being said, while language may have such <em>flaws</em> based on everyday logic, the sub-stratum is still very structured and can be analyzed, as we will discuss in subsequent articles.</li>
<li>Necessarily optimal/space efficient—the word <em>that</em> in <em>I think (that) he is not well</em> is optional, so, from considerations of space efficiency, there would be no point using it. Such logic does not work. Speakers are still free to use either of the two sentences and they are <em>both</em> perfectly grammatical.</li>
<li>Superior to other languages—there is nothing inherently superior about <em>Standard English</em> or about <em>Standard Hindi</em>, the kind we are taught as <em>correct</em>. What dialect of a language gets to be considered as the <em>prestige</em> <em>dialect</em> (a dialect which is considered as posh or educated or whose speakers are considered respectable) is a socio-political issue, not a linguistic one. All of the (close to) 6000 languages of the world show the same kind of underlying structure, whether they are spoken by people of developed nations or tribes in the Andamans.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s a list of a few <em>rules of English</em> which are <em>not</em> actually rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don’t split infinitives—it is perfectly grammatical (and often stylistically preferable) to insert an adverb between <strong>to</strong> and the <strong>verb</strong>. Eg<em>. …to boldly go where no man has gone before.</em></li>
<li>Don’t start sentences with conjunctions—it is perfectly fine to do so as long as you don’t create clumsy or fragmental sentences.</li>
<li>Don’t end sentences with prepositions—it is grammatical in English to do so. Eg. <em>What do you want the book for?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>However, please note that many teachers and editors might still insist that you follow these and several other silly rules. If your teacher/education board wants you to follow them, please do so, but please also keep in mind the spirit of looking at language in a scientific way.</p>

 The word bashful is closest in meaning to: A) Shy B) Arrogant
 About 6 years ago, I wrote about how I had discovered that I had been pronouncing awry, well, differently. I had another such moment of surprise last night, when I realized that the word bashful doesn&rsquo;t mean what I used to this it does.</div>

      <h2 class="title">Yet another woe of non-phonetic writing systems</h2>
      <div class="summary">I was in Mexico last week and was quite excited to try my Spanish there. I studied some Spanish 3–4 years ago using Michel Thomas courses, and did a few levels on Duolingo, and combined with my French, I can get a general sense of simple written Spanish, but I had literally zero on-ground speaking experience. There are plenty of Spanish speakers in California, so it&rsquo;s not difficult at all to find people to chat with if you really care, but it somehow never happened.</div>

      <div class="summary">Arpan suggested that I review Arrival, a SciFi movie that has as its lead character—wait for it—a linguistics professor. I first thought of writing a review without spoilers but realized that it&rsquo;d be impossible to write about the linguistically relevant parts of the movie without giving it all away, so I scrapped that plan. This review specifically addresses only and all linguistic aspects of the movie, so it might feel like nitpicking if you are not interested in all that stuff.</div>

      <div class="summary">RVC recently told me about Through the Language Glass, a book by Guy Deutscher (GD), an Israeli linguist, that is based around the premise of &lsquo;linguistic relativity&rsquo;. Ordinarily, hearing those two words together evokes a bit of a fight / flight response in me, so I read the excerpts he sent with some trepidation. I realized that, far from being yet another piece fawning over linguistic relativity, this book actually seemed to be addressing many questions I had about this topic but had never seen properly answered.</div>

Here are the links to the question set and the solutions. As part of the competition, I decided to put in a round of Hindi Cryptic Puzzles. Cryptic Crosswords are very popular in English, but haven&rsquo;t got much of a traction in the Hindi world. Regular crossword puzzles are fairly common—I remember solving the crossword in the Dainik Bhaskar growing up, but cryptics are relatively unchartered territory.</div>

      <div class="summary">A couple of days ago, I came across a few news reports that a professor from IIT Madras (Professor V Srinivas Chakravarthy) has developed a script (called Bharati) to &ldquo;unify 22 Indian languages&rdquo;. As a script-enthusiast, I was of course slightly interested.
There is a lot of self-congratulatory rhetoric in India about how Indian scripts are very &lsquo;scientific&rsquo;. On the contrary, the English script (which, in most cases, is the only other kind of script most Indians know) is criticized for being arbitrary, ambiguous, unscientific, what have you.</div>

It is such a remarkable mix of bad linguistics and general cluelessness that I would have thought that even with media&rsquo;s generally low standards of science (especially language) reporting, something like this would not have made the cut.
First of all, I am not sure why they even chose to write a whole article around this SaypU thing.</div>
