<p>14th September is celebrated in India as <em>Hindi Divas</em> (हिंदी दिवस). Foreigners often find it weird that India needs to celebrate &lsquo;Hindi Day&rsquo;—one doesn&rsquo;t usually hear of &lsquo;French (language) Day&rsquo; being celebrated in France or &lsquo;English Day&rsquo; being celebrated in England. But in a country like India with no single linguistic identity, days like this make a reasonable amount of sense.</p>

<p>Anyhow, among many programs that will be held around the country today will be programs to promote what is called Shuddha Hindi (शुद्ध हिंदी). To put it simply, <em>Shuddha Hindi</em>, which I will call SH in this post, is Hindi that has been stripped of all words that do not derive from Sanskrit. There will be <em>Shuddha Hindi</em> speech competitions, where points will be docked off for every single use of a word of Arabic or Persian origin. I don&rsquo;t think I am wrong in guessing that somewhere in the country, people would be handing out SH glossaries to help you purify your language.</p>

<p>In SH, words like मौका or तोहफ़ा or phrases like आम तौर पर are down-market—अवसर, उपहार and साधारणतः is what they should be. Proponents of SH claim that non-SH forms are a result of the bastardization which has corrupted our pure <em>matrubhasha</em>, the one which has its origin in the glorious language of Gods, our very own <em>Sanskrut</em>. I extend my full support to any activities that are for promotion of Hindi among our people but I am sorry I can&rsquo;t be guilty of this linguistic imperialism.</p>

<p>Whose Hindi is <em>Shuddh Hindi</em>? It&rsquo;s certainly not the Hindi that popular media uses—Bollywood has largely embraced Hindi-Urdu, whose vocabulary can be adjusted to choose the target register or dialect. Bollywood songs use Hindi-Urdu. We speak Hindi-Urdu. Nor is Shuddha Hindi the Hindi that Premchand, arguably the most famous and prolific Hindi-Urdu writer of the 20th century wrote. A quick look at any Munshi Premchand piece will show that he used both Sanskritized and loan-words in his writings. Whose Hindi is it? Hardly anyone associates with it, and many have trouble even understanding it. Around the world, a lot of political issues have language at the core—the whole Catalan v/s Castillian Spanish is a prime example—but those people fight so that their version of the language gets official recognition. In India, we have movements to go back to a version no-one uses.</p>

<p>There are two issues here, not one—</p>

<ol>
<li>The imposition of a so-called prestige dialect. This is wrong but it&rsquo;s often necessary for purposes of standardization. Please note, however, that standardization can exist without imposition.</li>
<li>The idea that Sanskritized Hindi is superior. This is what I have a greater problem with. To believe and propound that Sankritized Hindi is the true Hindi, as Arvind explained in his comment below, is to ignore the very development of the language and cast a blind eye to the fact that the Hindi we speak today is no more Sanskrit than the English we speak today is Latin. Sanskritized Hindi is NOT some extinct language that we need to &lsquo;preserve&rsquo;. As a point of academic interest, we could maybe maintain a distinction, of course, but believing that you are doing some sort of linguistic preservation by trying to uphold Sanskritized Hindi is just plain delusional. Of course if the situation merits it, choose a more Sanskrit register—Mahabharat&rsquo;s characters, assuming they existed, never spoke Hindi, let alone a Sanskritized one. But it makes sense for them to speak SH on television as the language of that time couldn&rsquo;t have had the influence of Urdu, Persian, Arabic etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Proponents of SH lament the influence of the Mughal empire on Hindi, which brought about a significant change in the language. Hindi, according to them, should only be the Sansritized version. It&rsquo;s bad enough that Sanskrit has to bear all the faux-linguistic stupidity that is piled upon it, but please keep religio-political propaganda out of a language that a significant proportion of our population speaks.</p>

<p>This is also probably why most organizations that seem to work for the promotion of Hindi never manage to reach their target audience. They seem to be full of a bunch of snobs forever stuck up with some antiquated version of the language that nobody uses nor associates with.</p>

<p>You want to know why I care? I like Hindi. I like the language, and would want it to be promoted so that more people can associate with it (that&rsquo;s different from shoving the language down or up people&rsquo;s alimentary canal just so that they speak it). But as long as people stick around with this atavistic attitude, I am only going to cringe at the thought of being associated with a pro-Hindi organization.</p>

      <div class="summary">Quick question. Answer instictively without trying to over-analyze.
 The word bashful is closest in meaning to: A) Shy B) Arrogant
 About 6 years ago, I wrote about how I had discovered that I had been pronouncing awry, well, differently. I had another such moment of surprise last night, when I realized that the word bashful doesn&rsquo;t mean what I used to this it does.</div>

      <h2 class="title">Yet another woe of non-phonetic writing systems</h2>
      <div class="summary">I was in Mexico last week and was quite excited to try my Spanish there. I studied some Spanish 3–4 years ago using Michel Thomas courses, and did a few levels on Duolingo, and combined with my French, I can get a general sense of simple written Spanish, but I had literally zero on-ground speaking experience. There are plenty of Spanish speakers in California, so it&rsquo;s not difficult at all to find people to chat with if you really care, but it somehow never happened.</div>

      <div class="summary">Arpan suggested that I review Arrival, a SciFi movie that has as its lead character—wait for it—a linguistics professor. I first thought of writing a review without spoilers but realized that it&rsquo;d be impossible to write about the linguistically relevant parts of the movie without giving it all away, so I scrapped that plan. This review specifically addresses only and all linguistic aspects of the movie, so it might feel like nitpicking if you are not interested in all that stuff.</div>

      <div class="summary">RVC recently told me about Through the Language Glass, a book by Guy Deutscher (GD), an Israeli linguist, that is based around the premise of &lsquo;linguistic relativity&rsquo;. Ordinarily, hearing those two words together evokes a bit of a fight / flight response in me, so I read the excerpts he sent with some trepidation. I realized that, far from being yet another piece fawning over linguistic relativity, this book actually seemed to be addressing many questions I had about this topic but had never seen properly answered.</div>

      <div class="summary">I have a lot of interest in writing systems, which is why you will find a lot of posts on this blog around them. A few years ago, I wrote about the Bharati script, which was touted as an attempt to create a universal script for Indian languages. I had expressed measured skepticism about the idea, but had also said I would like to see the script, and luckily, was contacted by Chetan Shenoy, an undergrad from IIT Madras, who works under Prof Chakravarthy, the creator of the script.</div>

      <div class="summary">I recently set the &lsquo;question paper&rsquo; for the Hindi Word Games General Championship (GC) 1 at IIT Bombay. Here are the links to the question set and the solutions. As part of the competition, I decided to put in a round of Hindi Cryptic Puzzles. Cryptic Crosswords are very popular in English, but haven&rsquo;t got much of a traction in the Hindi world. Regular crossword puzzles are fairly common—I remember solving the crossword in the Dainik Bhaskar growing up, but cryptics are relatively unchartered territory.</div>

      <h2 class="title">One script to bind them all</h2>
      <div class="summary">A couple of days ago, I came across a few news reports that a professor from IIT Madras (Professor V Srinivas Chakravarthy) has developed a script (called Bharati) to &ldquo;unify 22 Indian languages&rdquo;. As a script-enthusiast, I was of course slightly interested.
There is a lot of self-congratulatory rhetoric in India about how Indian scripts are very &lsquo;scientific&rsquo;. On the contrary, the English script (which, in most cases, is the only other kind of script most Indians know) is criticized for being arbitrary, ambiguous, unscientific, what have you.</div>

      <div class="summary">I just came across this article on the BBC Website (Could a new phonetic alphabet promote world peace?) because it was posted in the /r/badlinguistics sub-reddit, and for good reason.
It is such a remarkable mix of bad linguistics and general cluelessness that I would have thought that even with media&rsquo;s generally low standards of science (especially language) reporting, something like this would not have made the cut.
First of all, I am not sure why they even chose to write a whole article around this SaypU thing.</div>

      <div class="summary">A comic that was doing the rounds a few months ago keeps getting revived every once in a while when it gets discovered by a new bunch of people.
