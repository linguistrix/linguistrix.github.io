<p>In this post-placement decadence, I went to watch <em>The Dirty Picture.</em> It had fairly decent reviews (some even said it was blousefull), and the tickets were fairly inexpensive—what more can a man want? Since this is a linguistics blog, I won&rsquo;t talk much about the movie. For instance, I won&rsquo;t say that I found the movie fairly _meh_ nor would I say that it was rather boring after the interval. I would also refrain from writing that you might want to consider watching _Puss in boots_ instead. Instead, I would talk about a thing of linguistic interest in this movie. It was this dialogue:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Touch toh bahuton ne kiya hai mujhe par chhua kisi ne nahin. (Many [men] have touched [verb in English] me, but no one has yet touched [same verb in Hindi] me)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those of you who don’t know Hindi might have said ‘Dude! WTF!?!’ on reading the translation. Well, this is also what Vivek and I said, though we are both native speakers of Hindi, so rest assured that nothing has been lost in translation.</p>

<p>I am aware that all languages have unique words which are often untranslatable into single-word expressions in other languages without losing their essence. A lot of people find this very exciting, and most articles talking about languages usually treat this as central to the discussion. And this fact also tends to be abused by people across the world who start drawing threads of causality between a language’s unique vocabulary and cultural facts surrounding people who speak that language. For instance, English probably does not have a word which means the same as the German S_chadenfreude,_ though we can of course describe it as <em>the joy you get out of other people&rsquo;s miseries,</em> and so on. However, claiming that Germans are more likely to be vindictive and vengeful than the Britons because of this one word is patently foolish, but this is the sort of argument that you find all over the place.</p>

<p>This made me question whether the dialogue writer was trying to allude to such a difference in meaning when they wrote that dialogue—and I haven’t been able to find any. The dialogue implied that touching is the pedestrian version of human contact, the sort of contact that comes as an occupational hazard of being a pseudo-prostitute. On the other hand, chhoona (<em>to touch</em> in Hindi) is the warm, loving and sensual version of the same contact that one would associate with the delicate touch of a true lover.</p>

<p>As someone who&rsquo;s perfectly fluent in both English and Hindi, I felt that this distinction had been pulled out of thin air. Interestingly, a song from this very movie—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ooh la la Ooh la la, tu hai meri fantasy… chhoona na chhoona na, ab main jawaan ho gayi.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>uses <em>chhoona</em> in the first sense.</p>

<p>Now, as I have often said on this blog, my aim at pointing these things out is not to quibble about language usage à la grammar Nazis. My aim is to look at the reasons why people choose to use language the way they do, and to look at what all goes on in our minds when we try to interpret what we hear or read.</p>

<p>One possible reason is that people associate some languages with _class_ or <em>style.</em> This is often because using a particular language is a mark of high register and erudition. Take, for instance, the use of Urdu words in Hindi songs. Often, they do help introduces subtle differences in meaning, but a lot of instances of Urdu in songs can be replaced with more everyday words without significant loss in meaning (but with significant loss in poetic value, of course). I have no problem with this. As I mentioned in a previous post, <a href="http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=74" title="Whose Hindi is it?">Whose Hindi is it?</a>, I am all for such assimilation. But none of it explains the dialogue. So it shall continue to be a mystery to me.</p>

 The word bashful is closest in meaning to: A) Shy B) Arrogant
 About 6 years ago, I wrote about how I had discovered that I had been pronouncing awry, well, differently. I had another such moment of surprise last night, when I realized that the word bashful doesn&rsquo;t mean what I used to this it does.</div>

      <div class="summary">I was in Mexico last week and was quite excited to try my Spanish there. I studied some Spanish 3–4 years ago using Michel Thomas courses, and did a few levels on Duolingo, and combined with my French, I can get a general sense of simple written Spanish, but I had literally zero on-ground speaking experience. There are plenty of Spanish speakers in California, so it&rsquo;s not difficult at all to find people to chat with if you really care, but it somehow never happened.</div>

      <div class="summary">Arpan suggested that I review Arrival, a SciFi movie that has as its lead character—wait for it—a linguistics professor. I first thought of writing a review without spoilers but realized that it&rsquo;d be impossible to write about the linguistically relevant parts of the movie without giving it all away, so I scrapped that plan. This review specifically addresses only and all linguistic aspects of the movie, so it might feel like nitpicking if you are not interested in all that stuff.</div>

      <div class="summary">RVC recently told me about Through the Language Glass, a book by Guy Deutscher (GD), an Israeli linguist, that is based around the premise of &lsquo;linguistic relativity&rsquo;. Ordinarily, hearing those two words together evokes a bit of a fight / flight response in me, so I read the excerpts he sent with some trepidation. I realized that, far from being yet another piece fawning over linguistic relativity, this book actually seemed to be addressing many questions I had about this topic but had never seen properly answered.</div>

Here are the links to the question set and the solutions. As part of the competition, I decided to put in a round of Hindi Cryptic Puzzles. Cryptic Crosswords are very popular in English, but haven&rsquo;t got much of a traction in the Hindi world. Regular crossword puzzles are fairly common—I remember solving the crossword in the Dainik Bhaskar growing up, but cryptics are relatively unchartered territory.</div>

      <h2 class="title">One script to bind them all</h2>
      <div class="summary">A couple of days ago, I came across a few news reports that a professor from IIT Madras (Professor V Srinivas Chakravarthy) has developed a script (called Bharati) to &ldquo;unify 22 Indian languages&rdquo;. As a script-enthusiast, I was of course slightly interested.
There is a lot of self-congratulatory rhetoric in India about how Indian scripts are very &lsquo;scientific&rsquo;. On the contrary, the English script (which, in most cases, is the only other kind of script most Indians know) is criticized for being arbitrary, ambiguous, unscientific, what have you.</div>

      <div class="summary">I just came across this article on the BBC Website (Could a new phonetic alphabet promote world peace?) because it was posted in the /r/badlinguistics sub-reddit, and for good reason.
It is such a remarkable mix of bad linguistics and general cluelessness that I would have thought that even with media&rsquo;s generally low standards of science (especially language) reporting, something like this would not have made the cut.
First of all, I am not sure why they even chose to write a whole article around this SaypU thing.</div>
