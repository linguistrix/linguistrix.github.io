          <p>My views on IITB lingo have changed considerably over the years. I used to find it &lsquo;positively revolting&rsquo; in freshman year, and this slowly changed to &lsquo;occasionally annoying&rsquo; somewhere around third year, finally settling at &lsquo;mostly harmless&rsquo;. I am sure reams of paper have been devoted towards discussing campus lingo in general (there&rsquo;s an entire <a href="http://www.qucosa.de/fileadmin/data/qucosa/documents/5134/data/MAthesis_EvelynRichter.pdf" target="_blank">Masters Thesis</a> about IITM lingo, for instance), so I won&rsquo;t discuss it here.</p>

<p>There are two reasons why I wrote this post, and critiquing IIT lingo isn&rsquo;t either of them—firstly, I wanted to demonstrate how we can investigate simple issues surrounding language usage by using freely and publicly available tools and resources, and secondly, I wanted to talk about how this teaches us to never _assume_ things right-away when dealing with linguistic issues, but to adopt a scientific approach where we try to look at data to prove or disprove our claims instead of blindly trusting our intuition. Let&rsquo;s dive into it.</p>

<p>I was reading _Right ho, Jeeves!_ by P G Wodehouse recently, and was surprised to read this line—</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>But when he comes leering at Anatole through skylights, just after I had with infinite pains and tact induced him to withdraw his notice, and makes him so temperamental that [&#8230;]</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of you may have guessed it right—it was the expression &lsquo;infinite pains&rsquo; that caught my attention. For those unfamiliar with IITB lingo, _infinite_ (and its short form infy/infi, pronounced [ɪnfi]) is used extensively at IITB, in primarily two syntactic roles—</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Aaj infi kaam tha.</em> (I had infi (a lot of) work today)</p>

<p><em>Infi sexy bandi hai yaar! :sigh:</em> ([She&rsquo;s] an infi (very) sexy chick man! :sigh:)</p>

<p><em>In-fye-night-ly lambe form bharne pade yaar LUH, GnP or CTI ke liye (Infinitely (very) long forms had to be filled for LUH and GnP)</em></p>

<p>_Yaar girlfriend ke saath raat ko sameer-hill gaya tha. Wahaan bhi vigilance waalon ne pakad liya. Ab infinite pain hoga._ (I had gone with my girlfriend to Sameer Hill, but vigilance personnel caught us there too. Now we&rsquo;ll have infinite (a lot of) trouble).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we have _infi,_ <em>infinite</em> and <em>infinitely</em>, and prosody is one factor which might make people choose the longer three/four syllable form over the short one.</p>

<p>Now, being surrounded by _infi_ all around, and never  having seen it much in mainstream English, I was drawn to the natural conclusion that it was an idiosyncratic feature of IITB lingo, and any text that uses such a construction would sound non-standard. Obviously then, reading _infinite pains_ in PGW piqued my curiosity. I wanted to find out whether such usage was common, so the first thing I did was use the search feature in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?lr=lang_en&tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=%22infinite+pains%22&num=30" target="_blank">Google Books</a>. The phrase &lsquo;infinite pains&rsquo; returns 195,000 results. Here are a few examples—</p>

<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/infpans.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-842" alt="infpans" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/infpans-300x61.png?fit=300%2C61" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/infpans.png?resize=300%2C61 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/infpans.png?w=446 446w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img class="aligncenter" alt="" src="http://books.google.co.jp/books?id=KQNWgVl37zYC&hl=ja&hl=ja&pg=PA124&img=1&zoom=3&sig=ACfU3U0i8eCrYPtqKp3peJuUwripku7Nbg&ci=169%2C181%2C781%2C188&edge=0" width="323" height="77" />
</p>

<p>Next, I went to <em><a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/">Open Source Shakespeare</a></em> to search for this phrase in Shakespeare&rsquo;s works. I didn&rsquo;t get any occurrence of &lsquo;infinite pains&rsquo;, but several instances of <em>infinite</em> being used the IITB lingo way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy (Hamlet)</p>

<p>I love thee infinitely (Henry IV)</p>

<p>Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace&#8230; (All&rsquo;s Well That Ends Well)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You get the idea.</p>

<p>Finally, I used the <a href="http://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=infinite+pains&amp;year_start=1740&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=0&amp;smoothing=5">Google n-gram viewer</a> to look at the usage frequency of this phrase. This not only corroborates previous data but also confirms my intuition to a certain extent—the usage frequency has been progressively reducing over the years.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://books.google.com/ngrams/chart?content=infinite%20pains&corpus=0&smoothing=5&year_start=1740&year_end=2000" width="450px" /></p>

<p>In general, it&rsquo;s best to follow a data-driven approach whenever a language issue is in question. In summary:</p>

<ul>
<li>A lot of text, easily searchable, is readily available online</li>
<li>Google Books search is a very good way of seeing language usage across 3–4 centuries</li>
<li>Google n-gram viewer is particularly useful to observe patterns in usage change over decades and centuries</li>
<li>Always approach a questioning attitude towards linguistic issues, instead of considering one&rsquo;s opinion as gospel truth</li>
<li>Keep thinking!</li>
</ul>

 The word bashful is closest in meaning to: A) Shy B) Arrogant

      <div class="summary">I was in Mexico last week and was quite excited to try my Spanish there. I studied some Spanish 3–4 years ago using Michel Thomas courses, and did a few levels on Duolingo, and combined with my French, I can get a general sense of simple written Spanish, but I had literally zero on-ground speaking experience. There are plenty of Spanish speakers in California, so it&rsquo;s not difficult at all to find people to chat with if you really care, but it somehow never happened.</div>

      <div class="summary">Arpan suggested that I review Arrival, a SciFi movie that has as its lead character—wait for it—a linguistics professor. I first thought of writing a review without spoilers but realized that it&rsquo;d be impossible to write about the linguistically relevant parts of the movie without giving it all away, so I scrapped that plan. This review specifically addresses only and all linguistic aspects of the movie, so it might feel like nitpicking if you are not interested in all that stuff.</div>

      <div class="summary">RVC recently told me about Through the Language Glass, a book by Guy Deutscher (GD), an Israeli linguist, that is based around the premise of &lsquo;linguistic relativity&rsquo;. Ordinarily, hearing those two words together evokes a bit of a fight / flight response in me, so I read the excerpts he sent with some trepidation. I realized that, far from being yet another piece fawning over linguistic relativity, this book actually seemed to be addressing many questions I had about this topic but had never seen properly answered.</div>

I had expressed measured skepticism about the idea, but had also said I would like to see the script, and luckily, was contacted by Chetan Shenoy, an undergrad from IIT Madras, who works under Prof Chakravarthy, the creator of the script.</div>

Here are the links to the question set and the solutions. As part of the competition, I decided to put in a round of Hindi Cryptic Puzzles. Cryptic Crosswords are very popular in English, but haven&rsquo;t got much of a traction in the Hindi world. Regular crossword puzzles are fairly common—I remember solving the crossword in the Dainik Bhaskar growing up, but cryptics are relatively unchartered territory.</div>

      <div class="summary">A couple of days ago, I came across a few news reports that a professor from IIT Madras (Professor V Srinivas Chakravarthy) has developed a script (called Bharati) to &ldquo;unify 22 Indian languages&rdquo;. As a script-enthusiast, I was of course slightly interested.
There is a lot of self-congratulatory rhetoric in India about how Indian scripts are very &lsquo;scientific&rsquo;. On the contrary, the English script (which, in most cases, is the only other kind of script most Indians know) is criticized for being arbitrary, ambiguous, unscientific, what have you.</div>

      <div class="summary">I just came across this article on the BBC Website (Could a new phonetic alphabet promote world peace?) because it was posted in the /r/badlinguistics sub-reddit, and for good reason.
It is such a remarkable mix of bad linguistics and general cluelessness that I would have thought that even with media&rsquo;s generally low standards of science (especially language) reporting, something like this would not have made the cut.
First of all, I am not sure why they even chose to write a whole article around this SaypU thing.</div>

      <h2 class="title">Orders When Pizza Yoda</h2>
      <div class="summary">A comic that was doing the rounds a few months ago keeps getting revived every once in a while when it gets discovered by a new bunch of people. The comic shows Yoda ordering pizza over the phone, but unable to get his order across because of his mangled word order. It&rsquo;s difficult to not feel pity for the battered Yoda shown in the last frame as he sits biting on a sandwich.</div>
