          <p>New day, new linguistic fodder to chew on, and another quick note!</p>

<p>From an article in today&rsquo;s HT:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;The SC had said that if there is no reason to disbelieve that the accused cannot be reformed or rehabilitated, a sentence of death would be erroneous.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The moment I read <em>&lsquo;no reason to disbelieve&rsquo;</em>, I knew there was a disaster waiting to happen, and I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed. There are a total of 4 negating elements in this text (<em>no reason</em>, <em>disbelieve</em>, <em>cannot be, erroneous</em>) and you will see that the meaning is virtually impossible to compute naturally. That is, when you read it without consciously trying to understand it, your brain is likely to not compute any definite meaning. You can of course sit over coffee and compute it element by element. I did that while walking from H3 to the Mech Department, and this is the conclusion (it is paraphrased, so it won&rsquo;t exactly match the statement)—&rdquo;If the accused can be reformed or rehabilitated, a death sentence should be given,&rdquo; which is of course not what the Supreme Court wanted to say.</p>

<p>Why does this happen? As has often been <a href="https://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=&amp;=&amp;q=site%3Aitre.cis.upenn.edu%2F~myl%2Flanguagelog+overnegation&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=#sclient=psy-ab&amp;hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;source=hp&amp;q=site:languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu%2Fnll+misnegation&amp;pbx=1&amp;oq=site:languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu%2Fnll+misnegation&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=1&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=3309l4812l0l6052l11l8l0l0l0l0l315l1779l0.3.4.1l8l0&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&amp;fp=ec7fae886d32900d&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=699">commented upon</a> on LanguageLog, our little monkey brains find it rather difficult to handle more than 3 or 4 levels of negation, and they just start to shake and sputter and overheat before completely giving up. We then use our intuition to compute the meaning. In the above sentence, almost all readers would assume the sensible conclusion—&rdquo;If there is any possibility of reform, one should not give the death sentence&rdquo;, which is exactly opposite to what ends up being computed.</p>

<p>Note that this is different from sentences like &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothing&rdquo; or &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need no education&rdquo;. In Standard English, their truth values would be opposite of the intended ones, but in many dialects of English, including African American Vernacular English (AAVE), they are perfectly grammatical and intentional. And such constructions are also sometimes used intentionally by speakers of Standard English. Misnegation, on the other hand, is when the author intended to convey the opposite meaning, but ended up getting entangled in a lump of negative particles and scalar predicates and produced semantic garble.</p>

<p>Misnegation is interesting since it helps us study the theoretical and practical limitations of the human brain in understanding language constructions. It is also very important for lawyers and lawmakers and law-interpreters, who will often find themselves in a fix—do you take the text at face value and derive an obviously wrong interpretation, or do you assume that the law-writer made a mistake and take the meaning that is more sensible? Often, the issue is not so cut-and-dried or obvious as the death sentence one. Look around yourself, and you will find several examples of misnegation in everyday life!</p>

      <div class="summary">Quick question. Answer instictively without trying to over-analyze.
 The word bashful is closest in meaning to: A) Shy B) Arrogant
 About 6 years ago, I wrote about how I had discovered that I had been pronouncing awry, well, differently. I had another such moment of surprise last night, when I realized that the word bashful doesn&rsquo;t mean what I used to this it does.</div>

      <h2 class="title">Yet another woe of non-phonetic writing systems</h2>
      <div class="summary">I was in Mexico last week and was quite excited to try my Spanish there. I studied some Spanish 3–4 years ago using Michel Thomas courses, and did a few levels on Duolingo, and combined with my French, I can get a general sense of simple written Spanish, but I had literally zero on-ground speaking experience. There are plenty of Spanish speakers in California, so it&rsquo;s not difficult at all to find people to chat with if you really care, but it somehow never happened.</div>

      <div class="summary">Arpan suggested that I review Arrival, a SciFi movie that has as its lead character—wait for it—a linguistics professor. I first thought of writing a review without spoilers but realized that it&rsquo;d be impossible to write about the linguistically relevant parts of the movie without giving it all away, so I scrapped that plan. This review specifically addresses only and all linguistic aspects of the movie, so it might feel like nitpicking if you are not interested in all that stuff.</div>

      <h2 class="title">Book Review: Through the Language Glass by Guy Deutscher</h2>
      <div class="summary">RVC recently told me about Through the Language Glass, a book by Guy Deutscher (GD), an Israeli linguist, that is based around the premise of &lsquo;linguistic relativity&rsquo;. Ordinarily, hearing those two words together evokes a bit of a fight / flight response in me, so I read the excerpts he sent with some trepidation. I realized that, far from being yet another piece fawning over linguistic relativity, this book actually seemed to be addressing many questions I had about this topic but had never seen properly answered.</div>

      <div class="summary">I have a lot of interest in writing systems, which is why you will find a lot of posts on this blog around them. A few years ago, I wrote about the Bharati script, which was touted as an attempt to create a universal script for Indian languages. I had expressed measured skepticism about the idea, but had also said I would like to see the script, and luckily, was contacted by Chetan Shenoy, an undergrad from IIT Madras, who works under Prof Chakravarthy, the creator of the script.</div>

      <div class="summary">I recently set the &lsquo;question paper&rsquo; for the Hindi Word Games General Championship (GC) 1 at IIT Bombay. Here are the links to the question set and the solutions. As part of the competition, I decided to put in a round of Hindi Cryptic Puzzles. Cryptic Crosswords are very popular in English, but haven&rsquo;t got much of a traction in the Hindi world. Regular crossword puzzles are fairly common—I remember solving the crossword in the Dainik Bhaskar growing up, but cryptics are relatively unchartered territory.</div>

      <div class="summary">A couple of days ago, I came across a few news reports that a professor from IIT Madras (Professor V Srinivas Chakravarthy) has developed a script (called Bharati) to &ldquo;unify 22 Indian languages&rdquo;. As a script-enthusiast, I was of course slightly interested.
There is a lot of self-congratulatory rhetoric in India about how Indian scripts are very &lsquo;scientific&rsquo;. On the contrary, the English script (which, in most cases, is the only other kind of script most Indians know) is criticized for being arbitrary, ambiguous, unscientific, what have you.</div>

      <div class="summary">I just came across this article on the BBC Website (Could a new phonetic alphabet promote world peace?) because it was posted in the /r/badlinguistics sub-reddit, and for good reason.
It is such a remarkable mix of bad linguistics and general cluelessness that I would have thought that even with media&rsquo;s generally low standards of science (especially language) reporting, something like this would not have made the cut.
First of all, I am not sure why they even chose to write a whole article around this SaypU thing.</div>

      <div class="summary">A comic that was doing the rounds a few months ago keeps getting revived every once in a while when it gets discovered by a new bunch of people. The comic shows Yoda ordering pizza over the phone, but unable to get his order across because of his mangled word order.
