          <p>Sindhu, a lawyer friend, sent me this on chat:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>You should do a post on who v. whom. VERY confusing, I say!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>&#8230;</em> to which I replied that she didn&rsquo;t need to worry about it and as long as she trusted her instinct, it was just fine, but she said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Yes, but it is important to know the difference.  At our firm, we are very particular about pristine English in mails to clients.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since this is the first problem submitted to the Linguistrix Consulting Department, we would oblige with a quick answer. And Sindhu, since you are our first customer, it&rsquo;s on the house!</p>

<p>As a general rule of thumb, if an educated* speaker with native or near native fluency feels confused about a grammatical rule, and if a lot of such speakers sitting together can&rsquo;t resolve this over coffee, there is a very strong reason to suspect that the rule is not entirely relevant. This has certainly become the case with the whole <em>who/whom</em> issue, which tends to flummox people with otherwise impeccable grammar. The _rule_ is fairly straightforward—use _who_ when it&rsquo;s a subject, _whom_ when it&rsquo;s an object. But over the years, and when I say years, I mean centuries, it has always lain in a grey region. If you want to get some perspective, I will refer you to the MWDEU (Merriam-Webster&rsquo;s dictionary of English Usage), which I recommended in <a title="Nobody Cares" href="http://www.linguistrix.com/blog/?p=92" target="_blank">a previous post</a>. It devotes almost 2 entire pages only to this issue, and there is no point in repeating all that it says, so I will direct you to <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA957#v=onepage&q=whom&f=false" target="_blank">the relevant page</a>. Please read what&rsquo;s written there—it&rsquo;s fairly comprehensive. One thing is clear—it&rsquo;s not at all as cut-and-dried as we would hope or imagine.</p>

<p>The status quo is that some uses of _whom_ sound perfectly natural, others sound OK, and the rest sound outright affected and pretentious. Also, _whom_ is not in danger of extinction, but using _whom_ in all cases where you are questioning the object might make you sound very pompous. What should be used where is something I can&rsquo;t advise Sindhu or her colleagues about, especially since I am not aware of what her firm considers pristine English—would splitting infinitives, ending sentences with prepositions, starting them with conjunctions, saying things like <em>It is me</em>, and half a dozen other mistakes-that-aren&rsquo;t-really-mistakes be considered as wrong English? But if she wants a quick guide to figuring out where one should use <em>whom</em> (as far as the subject-object definition goes), a simple way would be to see which out of _he_ or _him_ fits in the sentence—if it&rsquo;s <em>him</em>, go for <em>whom</em>. Of course, this doesn&rsquo;t account for all the examples listed by MWDEU, but hey, I never said I was giving you a rule to produce natural-sounding sentences.</p>

<p>As a mnemonic, associate the <em>m</em> of <em>whom</em> with the <em>m</em> of <em>him/them</em>.</p>

<ul>
<li>She loved hi<strong>m → </strong>Who<strong>m</strong> did she love?</li>
<li>I slapped hi<strong>m</strong> → Who<strong>m</strong> did I slap?</li>
<li>He was slapped by the<strong>m</strong> → Who was slapped by who<strong>m</strong>?</li>
</ul>

<div>
  I have noticed that people tend to not use <em>whom</em> in cases where it moves to the front of the clause due to wh-movement, but use <em>whom</em> if it remains in the original position. Compare:
</div>

<blockquote>
<div>
  <em>Who did you talk to? </em>v. <em>You talked to whom? </em>
</div>
</blockquote>

<div>
  The second sentence is not grammatical as an isolated utterance, but it can still be expected to be produced in a conversation:
</div>

<blockquote>
<div>
  A: Who did you talk to?
</div>

<div>
  B: So, well, I thought about your proposal and I also talked to Yoda about this&#8230;
</div>

<div>
  A: Whoa! You talked to <em>whom</em>?
</div>
</blockquote>

<p>I strongly prefer this kind of usage, although, technically, it should have been <em>whom</em> in both cases. This is of course my personal preference. I am not making any claims about its generality.</p>

<p>[*I added <em>educated</em> here because an educated speaker is more likely to be well-versed with the _standard_ or <em>prestige</em> dialect of a language. Needless to say, one does not need education to acquire any and all the rules of their native dialect.]</p>

      <div class="summary">Quick question. Answer instictively without trying to over-analyze.
 The word bashful is closest in meaning to: A) Shy B) Arrogant
 About 6 years ago, I wrote about how I had discovered that I had been pronouncing awry, well, differently. I had another such moment of surprise last night, when I realized that the word bashful doesn&rsquo;t mean what I used to this it does.</div>

      <div class="summary">I was in Mexico last week and was quite excited to try my Spanish there. I studied some Spanish 3–4 years ago using Michel Thomas courses, and did a few levels on Duolingo, and combined with my French, I can get a general sense of simple written Spanish, but I had literally zero on-ground speaking experience. There are plenty of Spanish speakers in California, so it&rsquo;s not difficult at all to find people to chat with if you really care, but it somehow never happened.</div>

      <div class="summary">Arpan suggested that I review Arrival, a SciFi movie that has as its lead character—wait for it—a linguistics professor. I first thought of writing a review without spoilers but realized that it&rsquo;d be impossible to write about the linguistically relevant parts of the movie without giving it all away, so I scrapped that plan. This review specifically addresses only and all linguistic aspects of the movie, so it might feel like nitpicking if you are not interested in all that stuff.</div>

      <div class="summary">RVC recently told me about Through the Language Glass, a book by Guy Deutscher (GD), an Israeli linguist, that is based around the premise of &lsquo;linguistic relativity&rsquo;. Ordinarily, hearing those two words together evokes a bit of a fight / flight response in me, so I read the excerpts he sent with some trepidation. I realized that, far from being yet another piece fawning over linguistic relativity, this book actually seemed to be addressing many questions I had about this topic but had never seen properly answered.</div>

Here are the links to the question set and the solutions. As part of the competition, I decided to put in a round of Hindi Cryptic Puzzles. Cryptic Crosswords are very popular in English, but haven&rsquo;t got much of a traction in the Hindi world. Regular crossword puzzles are fairly common—I remember solving the crossword in the Dainik Bhaskar growing up, but cryptics are relatively unchartered territory.</div>

      <div class="summary">A couple of days ago, I came across a few news reports that a professor from IIT Madras (Professor V Srinivas Chakravarthy) has developed a script (called Bharati) to &ldquo;unify 22 Indian languages&rdquo;. As a script-enthusiast, I was of course slightly interested.
There is a lot of self-congratulatory rhetoric in India about how Indian scripts are very &lsquo;scientific&rsquo;. On the contrary, the English script (which, in most cases, is the only other kind of script most Indians know) is criticized for being arbitrary, ambiguous, unscientific, what have you.</div>

It is such a remarkable mix of bad linguistics and general cluelessness that I would have thought that even with media&rsquo;s generally low standards of science (especially language) reporting, something like this would not have made the cut.
First of all, I am not sure why they even chose to write a whole article around this SaypU thing.</div>
