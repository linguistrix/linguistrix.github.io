  <a href="https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_1490.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-153" title="IMG_1490" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_1490.jpg?fit=358%2C269" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_1490.jpg?w=448 448w, https://i2.wp.com/www.linguistrix.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_1490.jpg?resize=300%2C224 300w" sizes="(max-width: 358px) 100vw, 358px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>

<p>On reading it for the first time, I got what it meant to say, and you would too, because my mind was primed by &lsquo;SIX DAYS&rsquo;, and was expecting information about which day wasn&rsquo;t included. But, it struck me as slightly weird, so I backtracked, and there it was. When you interpret it literally, you are in a fix. I get a feeling that the person typing the notice was planning to write something like &lsquo;ALL DAYS EXCEPT SATURDAY&rsquo;, but then thought that a numerical quantifier like &lsquo;SIX&rsquo; would emphasize the frequency better, and ended up with this jumble. Alternatively, he might have planned &lsquo;SIX DAYS&rsquo;, and then realized that he hadn&rsquo;t mentioned which day the service didn&rsquo;t run, and added the very idiomatic &lsquo;EXCEPT SATURDAY&rsquo; bit at the end, forgetting what he had begun with. Either way, this doesn&rsquo;t appear to be the result of language ignorance so much as a simple goof-up. That is, it seems to be an issue of performance rather than competence.</p>

      <div class="summary">Quick question. Answer instictively without trying to over-analyze.
 The word bashful is closest in meaning to: A) Shy B) Arrogant
 About 6 years ago, I wrote about how I had discovered that I had been pronouncing awry, well, differently. I had another such moment of surprise last night, when I realized that the word bashful doesn&rsquo;t mean what I used to this it does.</div>

      <h2 class="title">Yet another woe of non-phonetic writing systems</h2>
      <div class="summary">I was in Mexico last week and was quite excited to try my Spanish there. I studied some Spanish 3–4 years ago using Michel Thomas courses, and did a few levels on Duolingo, and combined with my French, I can get a general sense of simple written Spanish, but I had literally zero on-ground speaking experience. There are plenty of Spanish speakers in California, so it&rsquo;s not difficult at all to find people to chat with if you really care, but it somehow never happened.</div>

      <div class="summary">Arpan suggested that I review Arrival, a SciFi movie that has as its lead character—wait for it—a linguistics professor. I first thought of writing a review without spoilers but realized that it&rsquo;d be impossible to write about the linguistically relevant parts of the movie without giving it all away, so I scrapped that plan. This review specifically addresses only and all linguistic aspects of the movie, so it might feel like nitpicking if you are not interested in all that stuff.</div>

      <div class="summary">RVC recently told me about Through the Language Glass, a book by Guy Deutscher (GD), an Israeli linguist, that is based around the premise of &lsquo;linguistic relativity&rsquo;. Ordinarily, hearing those two words together evokes a bit of a fight / flight response in me, so I read the excerpts he sent with some trepidation. I realized that, far from being yet another piece fawning over linguistic relativity, this book actually seemed to be addressing many questions I had about this topic but had never seen properly answered.</div>

      <div class="summary">I have a lot of interest in writing systems, which is why you will find a lot of posts on this blog around them. A few years ago, I wrote about the Bharati script, which was touted as an attempt to create a universal script for Indian languages. I had expressed measured skepticism about the idea, but had also said I would like to see the script, and luckily, was contacted by Chetan Shenoy, an undergrad from IIT Madras, who works under Prof Chakravarthy, the creator of the script.</div>

      <div class="summary">I recently set the &lsquo;question paper&rsquo; for the Hindi Word Games General Championship (GC) 1 at IIT Bombay. Here are the links to the question set and the solutions. As part of the competition, I decided to put in a round of Hindi Cryptic Puzzles. Cryptic Crosswords are very popular in English, but haven&rsquo;t got much of a traction in the Hindi world. Regular crossword puzzles are fairly common—I remember solving the crossword in the Dainik Bhaskar growing up, but cryptics are relatively unchartered territory.</div>

He rose to fame in 2010 for his TED Talk on Sixth Sense, a wearable gestural interface that augments the physical world around us with digital information and lets us use natural hand gestures to interact with it (Description sourced from his website).
  Since then, he has been in and out of limelight, and has generally been on the receiving end of a lot of (well deserved) love and admiration from Indians, especially because he comes off as a &lsquo;son of the soil&rsquo;.</div>

      <h2 class="title">One script to bind them all</h2>
      <div class="summary">A couple of days ago, I came across a few news reports that a professor from IIT Madras (Professor V Srinivas Chakravarthy) has developed a script (called Bharati) to &ldquo;unify 22 Indian languages&rdquo;. As a script-enthusiast, I was of course slightly interested.
There is a lot of self-congratulatory rhetoric in India about how Indian scripts are very &lsquo;scientific&rsquo;. On the contrary, the English script (which, in most cases, is the only other kind of script most Indians know) is criticized for being arbitrary, ambiguous, unscientific, what have you.</div>

      <div class="summary">I just came across this article on the BBC Website (Could a new phonetic alphabet promote world peace?) because it was posted in the /r/badlinguistics sub-reddit, and for good reason.
It is such a remarkable mix of bad linguistics and general cluelessness that I would have thought that even with media&rsquo;s generally low standards of science (especially language) reporting, something like this would not have made the cut.
First of all, I am not sure why they even chose to write a whole article around this SaypU thing.</div>

      <div class="summary">A comic that was doing the rounds a few months ago keeps getting revived every once in a while when it gets discovered by a new bunch of people. The comic shows Yoda ordering pizza over the phone, but unable to get his order across because of his mangled word order. It&rsquo;s difficult to not feel pity for the battered Yoda shown in the last frame as he sits biting on a sandwich.</div>
